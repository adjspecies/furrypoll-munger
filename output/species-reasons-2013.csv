horse,"Familiarity, experience, and similar behavior traits."
raccoon,They eat garbage.  Nom.
squirrel,Nope.
wolf,I identify with a wolf because I feel it has aspects that I have myself as well as I like wolfs. I feel it kind of represents me because I am very quiet I am very methodical I can get a point across with nothing but my stare. But I have also often been described as having wolf like eyes because of their color and looks. And I also chose it because I like identifying as a wolf I dont know why I just feel happy identifying as a wolf. I mean even now typing about how I identify as a wolf I feel slightly happy as appose to if I was just sitting here doing nothing being indifferent.
redpanda,Yes.  I like them.
wolf,"Armadillo is because that is the animal research. Wolf because I probably feel the greatest overall affinity, but I focus on red wolf because I am not quite as pack oriented as grey wolf but still more than a cat/ Cougar, I do have some affinity for it.

I do like lots of animals and find most have some admiral traits and/or are interesting."
cougar,Cats seemed to be more similar to my own personality.

dragon,Because it's me? This is who I am
domesticcat,"If you die alone in your apartment and no one finds you for a week, your dog will starve. Your cat will not. There's something very unsentimental about them that I've always found appealing."
wolf,"I find them fascinating and admirable and, illogical as it may be, feel an ineffable association with them.
I also find them (and many other animals for that matter) aesthetically beautiful."
raccoon,Am nocturnal.
redfox,I feel that my personality lines up with the way the fox has traditionally been portrayed in human culture.

dragon,Not too sure
wolf,It just feels right
otherdog,"(Canine, Dog, Papillon) I just think they're adorable."
wolf,"Pretty much along the lines of 'Wolves are cool', and if the question 'if you had to be an anthropomorphic animal, which would it be?' were posed, that'd be my answer."
dragon,I like dragons. 
kitsune,"Actually, Kitsune Fennec Fox. Fennecs are small and cute, for a while I was very short, and I make noise that some people say sound like a fennec. Generally fond of them."
dinosaur,"Needed a fursona, random choice that seemed a bit individual compared to other people's fursona choices."

wolf,"I like dogs

(Pretty simple really :P)"
otherdog,"Birth date's Chinese Year's Animal.
"

arcticfox,"Aesthetics, behavior"
wolf,"Among other reasons, the mexican gray wolf is native to my area, and was also the first wolf I saw; I felt a connection with her when I did."
otherreptile,"My original identification was as a dragon, but it's more complex now. My current primary identification is as a ""draconid,"" an anthro-saurian species with many draconic and saurian characteristics. My secondary identification is as a velociraptor, which I use more widely and publicly. I use ""dragon"" or ""raptor"" as a kind of shorthand identification for people who don't know my full story."
redfox,"I feel a connection to red foxes. I think they look lovely, and sometimes feel as if I have fox ears or a fox tail. I identify strongly with the perception of foxes in culture as clever and tricky, sometimes too much for their own good. There might also be an aspect of rebellion against the Korean culture to which I also belong - foxes occupy a role in Korean mythology similar to that of snakes, black cats, or bats in Western mythology as ""evil"" creatures."
dragon,It is what I am and most desire to be.
snowleopard,"Quiet, shy, enjoy cold."
wolf,"I tend to be mostly leading the people around me, will mostly think of the group before myself and have a tendency to stick with a group of people for a while instead of jumping between groups of friends all the time (pack philosophy)."
riverotter,"Fits my personality. It's become a part of me at this point,"
wolf,I adopt certain trails of the wolf.
redfox,"I did a lot of random research in choosing an animal; I wanted an animal that had behaviors and characteristics that matched my personality/skills/traits/whatnot in some vaguely close form - the one that won out was the red fox.  Due to the Asian/European mix I am in terms of ethnicity, I felt that it would be more... urm... 'realistic' if I were a corsac/red mix."
lion,TLK was the most inspiring to me during pre-puberty and adolescence.
lizard,"i have always loved reptile's. and chose a comodo dragon because i wanted to be somewhat unique.
"
wolf,I guess because with wolves and Huskies I just relate to their closeness and willingness to protect family and friends.
othercanine,I really like the animal. 
wolf,"Loyal, determined and often alone.. with a violent streak. "
collie,Because other people tell me to :/ And I lack self-definition.
otherreptile,"They're animals I either admire/share the generalised anthropomorphised traits with, or just ones that I like."
jackal,Behavioural traits that are somewhat a caricature of my own.
horse,"I identify with dinosaurs the most because I have studied them since I was 4 years old, and they always capture my imagination. I enjoy looking at gray foxes, tigers, and horses, but I don't feel that I identify with these fursonas as strongly as I do with dinosaurs. "
wolf,"Animal characteristics, attributes or generalized personality"
husky,"Cause huskies are cute, cuddly and playful like me :P"

Dragons are fierce and powerful, with thousands of myths and terror stories about them."
otherdog,"The dog is a symbol of loyalty, before anything else.  It is also highly gregarious and my basic set of desires and the skill sets that represent them are social in nature.  Also, I am sexually active only along the dominant - submissive axis, and dogs represent a type of submission that I am very attracted to enacting.  "
kangaroo,It was my first choice going in. I thought it was unique as well as a representation of how I felt coming into the fandom.
raven,"An animal tends to have particular personality traits that are often associated with it- I felt that based on these perceived personality traits, I closely matched with what I chose. There are multiple animals that fit closely. With these personality traits in mind, some people can have a bias immediately (without even meeting), and this actually helps to filter those who may not prefer a particular personality."
domesticcat,No reason in particular!
otherfeline,"unfortunately, i have multiple characters that i also use as fursonas. my main is a snow leopard/cougar hybrid that just seems more me than the others. its the elusive mystery of those two that makes me feel like it suits"
tiger,"Similar attributes and characteristics with real life persona. Matching Chinese zodiac animal (tiger), commonly worn clothing brand (puma)."
husky,"I like the shape of canids, and enjoy drawing them."
coyote,Nope.
horse,Always had a love of all things Equine!
horse,"Many, because of reasons."

redfox,"I find the animal to be one of my favorites, with a mixture of cat and dog qualities. "
lizard,"Came from a dream I had which lead me to discover the furry fandom. My species, character design and name all came directly from the dream."
coyote,Yes
otherdog,"In both cases, the animals with which I identify typify traits to which I aspire.

Dog (other)-- specifically, dingo-- is my ""cub"" side. When I'm in this headspace, I aspire to be playful, affectionate, loyal, trusting-- in general, the positive aspects of ""childlike"".

Zebra is my adult side. The zebra represents decisiveness, strength, and confidence."
wolf,It just feels natural....
domesticcat,"Flighty temper, maybe."
tiger,Turtle Power (Rubber Turtle).  Tiger's are sexy.  ;)
otherfeline,"The species Lynx is also my daemon :see daemonism, philosophy. "
dragon,Dragons and reptiles are cool...
redfox,"I just know, Foxes are Awesome! :P"
hyaena,"Because everyone thinks that my personality fits it, since I tend to laugh a lot."
otherfox,Otherkin nature
cougar,"Not particularly. I chose it for reasons not dependant on what we have in common.
"
dragon,Fascination with myths and their characteristics. Other reasons are childish like it was something that I liked and I stuck with it for a long time. There also isn't any other animal which I identify better with.
otherdog,"Real canines repay all the love and hate they receive in droves, which I admire, and represent the frank, sometimes ill-informed, honesty and loyalty that I exude."
arcticfox,I'm not sure :3
husky,That i am I peacekeeper and really fun to hang with and just be yourself
rabbit,Nothing in particular
otherfeline,because i'm a cat person
rabbit,"My personality changes a lot.
I've chosen a hybrid for being angry/hyper, calm/happy, sad/relaxed"
wolf,I just feel like it's a part of who I am.
domesticcat,"Cats are simply the bestest ;-) Seriously, it's just.... it feels right :-)"
wolf,It is the most attractive as to my perspective.
othermustelid,"I identify with the ferret, mainly due to what it has stood for (wit, cunning, agility). Another factor was it's appearance and physical attributes, as well as location of where it naturally occurs and where I was born in real life."
dragon,Dragons are epic.
horse,Canines cause you know loyalty 
kangaroo,Cause they are cool and awesome
grizzlybear,I love these animals and they represent my attitude a lot.
husky,"I love being active physically and mentally and huskies have a way of showing both traits that best suit my character. I love learning new things and applying those learnt ideas to what I do in the real world.
"
otherdog,"Spiritual connection, part of me."
redfox,There are only a few reasons why I chose a female corsac fox as my fursona in the first place. One of them is because I'm usually mistaken as a girl in real life due to my face and body structure. 
dragon,I like dragons after I started liking Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon.
domesticcat,I admire cat capabilities.
redfox,"Foxes are clever, and dignified."
rabbit,"Mostly it just seems to be the default my mind ever pops to when I try to think of characters or etc., though sometimes it also goes with various, unspecific canines.
Fursonas, with me, are still a developing thing. Very liable to change and all."
domesticcat,"Mainly with Canine, Dog/other, I have identified desirable characteristics from it and adapted them to my own regular personality. These are loyalty, energy, empathy, curiosity and being carefree.

The minority with the others are desirable and undesirable parts of my personality not captured by the main. "
wolf,"General strong gravitation to large canines, and envy of them."
husky,Yes; personality.
domesticcat,Lazy bum and simplistic
redfox,I think personally I prefer these as some would be personality wise but seeing these in comics and a personality makes you think they would be pretty fun to be them
wolf,I was interested in werewolves and found out about furries while browsing werewolf communities.
wolf,"Wolves are sociable animal, yet content with nature. I feel closest to the wolves."
otherfeline,"Enfield (primary): I enjoy how it blends different animals together discordantly and is still a powerful and respected entity (among those aware of it). (In case you haven't googled it yet, it's got the head of a fox, body of a greyhound, hind legs of a lion, forelegs of an eagle, and the tail of a wolf. It is associated with the sea and honor in Irish folklore and heraldry.)"
skunk,Yes
deer,Antlers are fucking cool
dragon,Personal preference.
grizzlybear,I love how big the bear is. and i love chubby things too.
redfox,"No particular reason. I just saw a picture of a anthro red fox one day and said to myself ""it would be awesome to have a red fox as a fursona"" and bam, it fit me like a glove. Never considered changing fursona after that."
dragon,"I used to feel that I am a dragon in spirit (otherkin).  These feelings are less strong now, but I still have a great love and respect for dragons."
otherdog,"I identify myself in a Wolf/Dog because I feel my self confuse in what am I, as the Wolf/Dog that is split in two sides."
dragon,"Nothing obvious, I guess I just have always liked dragons??"
raccoon,I love feeling sneaky and raccoons have a natural mask! :3  Plus the ringed tail is supercute.
redfox,"no particular reason i just love canines
"
wolf,Probably
bat,Because they're awesome
jackal,There just some of my favorite animals.
redfox,"Foxes have been my favorite animal for as long as I can remember. They're completely adorable. Also, I'm kind of a slut."
dragon,My first online character was on a MUD and I chose a 'halfdragon' character because I had been attracted to reptilian creatures previously. I adopted this character on my first Furry MUCK and found it useful as a fantasy 'starting point' without any hard limits or definitions. Since then I have adopted rottweiler and orca forms because their aesthetics pleased me.
otherfeline,"Well, cats and dragons are great, so... catdragons are even better!
"
wolf,Wolves are beautiful animal built for strength and speed
wolf,Favourite animals actually. And people say personality of a wolf suits me a lot
coyote,"Coyote is a trickster, iconoclastic, adaptable. Can be seen as absurd or cunning, often switching between from moment to moment. Basically a label that says 'don't label me'."
wolf,The wolf totem represents who I am and what I want to become
riverotter,"At the time I picked it, swimming was one of my favourite things. Since then, it just kind of stuck."
dragon,"Yes, there are certain traits in those animals that I exhibit. "
cheetah,"A cheetah is lean and lithe like me, and my first avatar colors on Furcadia were (just by chance) red/black/yellow, specifically with yellow fur and black markings, so I just ran with that when I was a kid. I've always loved the concept of flight and feathers and so she has wings (hence bird of prey), and some Bengal tiger stripes because she's a mutt and oddly marked like I am in real life."
otherfeline,"I share some of the real and imagined characteristics of the feline/other (meerkat): family oriented, tall and lanky, and skittish. "
arcticfox,"I feel connected to the Arctic Fox, I feel as if it fits my personality."
wolf,"I Had a dream a few nights about being a red wolf and talking to one. My cousin told me It was my ""spirit animal/guide"" because we are native American and what I had was a vision. "
coyote,"Yew

... I suppose this wants me to describe it, too. :)  Personality traits are definitely a part of it, both ones I have and ones I want to develop, but a lot of it comes down to just an internal pull in a certain direction, and with boh species components, it was more a matter of first saying ""I feel like X"" and then later working out the personalty and aspiration reasons for that."
otherfox,"I have a fox/wolf fursona, I however don't know why identify with these animals."
otherfeline,"I believe I posses a number of catlike characteristics , such as a finicky nature, and an attitude which alternates between the quiet, calculating stoicism of a hunter, and the laid-back, silly nature of a cat at play.

The relative obscurity and lanky physiology attracted me to servals specifically, which both somewhat reminded me of myself. Although I am not currently socially active in the furry community, I have chosen a serval to serve as my personal de-facto fursona at the present time."
horse,I just feel like a horse and relate to them
collie,"I'm the complete opposite of my fursona in real life. Lazy, inactive, disloyal. It's fantastic."
domesticcat,I really don't know why honestly. The cat just seems to fit me well.
bat,Favorites.
raven,"I did choose raven for several reasons. It is an animal that is mislabeled by society (as a symbol of death) when it's just a bird doing its own thing, really. They are chatty and creative (don't believe me? look at some videos), solving problems in unique ways while being generally curious, playful, and sometimes mischievous. I possess these traits, so it's a good fit there. Of course I also chose ravens because they look pretty, and they can fly, which is awesome.

In summary, there are symbolic aspects as well as ""ooh look at this cool animal"" aspects to my decision."
otherbear,"Yes! I feel the need to help my near and loved ones as much as posible, but at the same time they have to get ""rufft up"" from time to time so they learn that life isnt easy always."
riverotter,"Wiggle wiggle wiggle, yeah :D"
griffin,"Gryphons are loyal, and honest. I admire and I try to follow that in my real life. "
husky,"Husky/Labrador mix. Representative of two facets of my personality. One being aloof and reserved, and the other incredibly silly and playful."
dragon,"Sexual attraction, ability to have a feral character with sentience and ability to communicate and use tools, personal connection with certain traits typical of dragons (modified for specific subspecies)"
otherungulate,"I'm an aries, and sheep has always fit me well."
domesticcat,Because I feel it reasonates with my personality the closest of the many choices.
raccoon,"Personality, habits, interest."
otherfox,Just always favored being a fox among others.
wolf,"I have been a fan of wolves for a very long time, and I admire some of their traits, such as loyalty and perseverance. "
wolf,"like attributes, imagine anthro ver of them in a sexual way"
mouse,"Now I can say I just like the species, I have Aspergers Syndrome  and I had always had a fondness to animals and especially mice. But one of the reasons why I have chosen the sona is because of the traits that the mouse is related to (shyness, quite vibe, coward(also I was not happy when I joined so I felt awful about myself)) but also because of the fondness of mice.It is very original and I was very suprised at first that many people found it original, I found it very unoriginal when I made it. But I digress, as I grew up in the found I found and I  chose it because of everything, what it represented of me back then and a great fondness of mice. I obviously don't feel that bad about myself and have gained a lot of confidence in the last few years. "
othermustelid,I identify with ferrets because my personality is similar to a ferret.
othercanine,I like dogs. That's pretty much it.
redfox,"I took an animal personality test, and Fox personality was one of the results, and is probably the most accurate one.  Also got horse and penguin as possibilities, but truth be told, I don't think most people can be accurately described with only one animal within the context of that test."
wolf,I feel they are strong leaders with a great sense of pride and family values.
wolf,I work part-time at an environmental nonprofit with wolves.  I had to.
dragon,"It's one of those creatures where I do not necessarily identify with those around me nor the stereotypes presented in modern literature/cinema... However there's this inexplicable pull towards the species, not for the perceived power nor the social status, but for the freedom it represents, the intelligence, loyalty, honour, among other things. "
husky,"I feel more closer and linked to them, more so the wolf then others."
grizzlybear,"The nature of the animal calls to me however, a Kodiak Bear is my fursona. "
coyote,"It matches closely to my personality, and they are among my favourite species."
domesticcat,"I have allways loved cats, i purr like one, i'm very curious, I like to scratch at things... I just feel that I have alot of Catlike characteristics. 

I choose Domesticated because I feel I more closely relate to how they act an respond to humans an other animals."
domesticcat,"Yes, but I don't have the words to explain it."
wolf,Cause I've always loved Wuskys growing up
tiger,"I've always loved felines, especially tigers. I think that a tiger is a good representation of my stubborn and defensive side whereas a cat fits my generally tame and submissive demeanor."
redpanda,"I find red panda's to suit my personality, as the cute fluffy balls of energy. plus, cute. 


cute cute cute."
squirrel,I like dicks so i fucking chose one. <3 ;)
raven,"Not particularly. I tend to refer to myself as a gray raven. I have been going grey since I was a teen, and tend to be in my shell/nesting at home quite a lot. I do notice ravenish traits I suppose in myself. The desire to hoard shiny things, the intelligence. "
dragon,"I have always adored dragons, and felt a feeling of familiarity and comfort when hearing stories about them. This, among other things, lead me to understand that I am and Otherkin."
redfox,'cause of Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog
otherfox,"A dragon because they are awesome, and one of the main characters in my fantasy world is a dragon, and thus represents a significant part of myself. A fox simply because everyone has a fox fursona."
coyote,"While I don't especially like outing my identity as Otherkin, I tend to use ""spotted hyena"" as a common identity because the animals are intelligent, loyal, and charming but have been frequently scapegoated. I also like horse as an identifier because I can be high strung, and other traits - such as my fondness for vegetables."
tiger,"When I was first introduced to the furry fandom, I considered myself to be a tiger-striped domestic cat, but since realizing that I am otherkin, I now consider myself to have the spirit of a Tigress in me."
wolf,"Loyal , loving , sly , cunning , strong , Love for Canine's"
tiger,I am unsure.
kitsune,"I used to have dreams all the time, even before I knew about the furry fandom, as a child. There was always the same fox there, and we played together."
redfox,It  sums up who or what I want to be 
dragon,"I'm not sure, it's just my fursona ^.=.^"
otherfox,Dog
wolf,"Wolf is my spirit animal, and I share more than one attribute with the wolf."
jackal,"I`ve ever felt an strong bound between me and the Jackal One, as He is my Inner self. "
rabbit,Yes... 
redfox,I'm a red fox because people call me sly and quick. I am also a bit devious and one to be watched.
hyaena,"He is cute, interesting and I have fun playing him."
grizzlybear,"I like dogs.  I've always been associated with a Grizzly by my friends.  I like hybrids, because I want to be as original as my imagination will allow."
snowleopard,I have always been connected with the Snow Leopard since I had this very vivid dream when I was 15.
hyaena,Personalities and specific traits they have that i can relate to.
jackal,"Canines are loyal and trustful, and I do my best to beloyal to my friends."
otherbird,"I'm a scarlet tanager. I love birds, and I find tanagers to be pretty, and I'm actually able to draw them."
riverotter,I find the otter aesthetically pleasing as well as the personality similarities. I just feel right as an otter.
tiger,I am loyal to those who know me but would rather lay around and do nothing.
raven,have been told I look and act like many of the selected above 
redfox,"I believe I share the same traits as a Red Fox, being sly, sneaky, though I don't approve of the stereotype of all foxes being... erm.. ""Loose"" with their sexuality"
redpanda,It's always been my favorite animal.
husky,"I'm not really sure, I just do."
wolf,Strong.
rabbit,They are all apart of my roster of 40 plus characters.
redfox,"Foxes are thought to be clever n' such, or at least in folklore and popular media (e.g. Fox's Cunning spell from D&D)."
redfox,"I Feel That The Red Fox Is Very Similar To Me, In The Way I Act."
othercanine,I have always had an attachment to white tigers ever since I was a little girl. I just think Dingoes have beautiful long ears and are adorable.
wolf,I identify with wolves mostly with my personality similarities with them and my mentality towards life and interactions with others.
otherdog,Matches my personality.
wolf,"Yes, but I do not feel like explaining.
(Antlered female wolf.)"
dragon,"I'm year of the dragon born, and my native American spirit animal is a black leopard, also known as panther, but panther could be others, such as a jaguar that is black. I noticed you don't list jaguar either, why do you leave them out?
I also noticed you did not put jack rabbit. You also list separate of domestic dogs, but group all domestic cats into one."
redfox,Suits my personality
husky,hard to explain really. it just fits.
othercanine,"Well my Folfingo fursona tells a story...enriched with inspiration of my family Native American influence by the two red scars on his cheeks, symbolizing the warrior. Being my fursona's eyes are blue represents clearity and focus, but mostly represents the qualities / similar body structure what I'd look like if I was a furry.

As reasons why and what they mean to me my strength of courage comes from the wolf, my cunning comes from the dingo in me and finally sly swift side comes from the fox part of me. My fursona has been inspiration even before knowledge of being a furry, and tells my story like anyone else story. From my high points to my low points, its what makes me unique as an individual, just like this melting pot of a world. "
othercanine,"The coyote because I seek solitude, an the striped hyena because i can be cruel but laugh at the same time."
lion,The lion represents strength and courage - something I as a human lack.  But I identify with most all anthro characteristics that are common belief about lions.  Leadership and all that sort of thing.
wolf,Always seemed to have a connection with the wolf
lion,favorite movie was The Lion King
husky,"Dog/canine-Because I'm loyal and protective
Feline-because Im cuddly, cute and am a tad nutty
Rabbit-Because I can be timid and shy  times, and Im considered wise for my age."
otherfox,"Just fits me. Sly, cunning."
dragon,n/a
germanshepherd,Not really. I just drew something one day and based the colors on the actual colors of my hair. I thought it looked like a German Shepherd. I chose dogs in the first place because I've just always liked dogs.
tiger,MY strong mind and body
tiger,"The overall behavioral patterns and such played a big part, but I have always felt drawn to Pantera tigris tigris. (Bengal Tiger)"
cheetah,"Cheetahs normally only let loose one burst of intense exertion, before stopping to rest for a rather long time. I identify with this trait, since I am rather lazy. Also, my physical body figure is really skinny, like that of a real cheetah's"
otherfox,I see myself as said animal.
rat,"intelligent, but sometimes misunderstood. makes a good friend and social to a certain extent."
cheetah,"I'm drawn to all felines, but cheetahs and lions more so."
deer,Many physical and behavioral similarities.
rabbit,"I've always been attracted to felines, they're both beautiful and strong, sensual and sultry, they tend to do what they like and have their own agendas as do I. Most of the time they seem to be very composed and aware of what's going on, observant.  At the same time they can be very compassionate and playful. Also I myself an from India, and I believe there's a connection with myself and tigers. "
otherfox,Foxes look cool.
squirrel,"Not really sure. Just feels right. Feels like me. Maybe will change one day, as I am new to the fandom."
otherbear,"It fits my personality quite well, and my appearance is also similar."
wolf,"Yes, but that's multiple very very long stories, lets just go with I've had an affinity for wolves since I was really little. Including getting the chance to meet one face to face, no fences, no nothing. They're highly misunderstood creatures. I guess I can feel sympathy with them because I'm also very misunderstood by a lot of people. Yes there my favorite animal, and I've been fascinated by them for as long as I can remember. I just have a personal connection with wolves. "
hyaena,Personality traits match closely. Scavenger
otherdog,"Intelligence, disposition, hair colour."
wolf,"When I discovered the fandom via Furcadia back in 05 I fell into the wolf dreams. Something just clicked within me and I knew that's what my fursona was, a wolf. My fursona also has wings because while I was growing up I always wanted to fly and put wings on everything I drew."
kangaroo,"In my furry world, my girlfriend/ wife would be a kangaroo. I know it doesn't that's what I am, I cannot find my fursona."
raccoon,"More like it chose me, but: intelligence, tenacity, fearless attitude, cleverness"
coyote,Spiritual & totemic identification
wolf,able to relate to its traits
redpanda,"Red Pandas are my favorite animals. Cute, playful, and friendly~ For some reason I've always felt comfortable having a red panda as my sona, and nothing else."
otherfox,Foxes have been my favorite animals since childhood.
otherfox,"i pick one at random initially, and stuck to it eventually"
tiger,"Tigers have always been important to me, from early childhood.  I thought I might be a wolf for a time (I often say I am 10% wolf), because I literally had a wolf shirt for every day of the week plus one for holidays, and wolf posters decorated my walls... but it's more that I enjoy wolves and admire them.  Inside, I relate to tigers more, have distinctly feline characteristics (that even non-furries have identified as such), and my totem animal is a tiger."
raccoon,"I feel that Raccoons/Tanooki best portray my personality traits. I also appreciate that they're more uncommon then other animal types, but no so uncommon that you can't find any others of them within the community. A raccoon mafia if you will."
redfox,"No, I just lovr them and think they are beautiful."
domesticcat,I like the way it looks
raccoon,Characteristics of the animal in how it acts. 
otherfeline,"Hmm, i'd have to say it's based on my actual personality, since, when faced with new people/things I can be quite rabbit like (Shy and timid for example) but when annoyed/angered/sad I can be quite rash/hasty and defensive like a feline. Other than that I've always liked the look of both the Eurasian Lynx and the Volcano Rabbit."
dragon,"Dragons are fucking awesome, they rip shit apart, breathe fire, are smart and cunning, they can motherfucking fly without all that stupid feather shit and their scales sparkle like a baby's eyes. Not being a dragon is like saying ""yeah, I want to be some bitch's winter coat."" They make fucking battle armor out of single scales."
otherdog,My character is a dalmatian. I've been fond of them since infancy.
dragon,I have just always felt a pull to the soul that I was a Dragon and have always seen myself as such.

"
wolf,"I like the animal, and I feel it shares some traits with me."
husky,"All my life, since I was just a toddler, I've ALWAYS had a very close connections with all dogs. To me, they are my brothers and sisters. But the specific reason I chose Canine, Husky is because I love cold climates and snow (and they're my favourite). Other than that, I dont feel like a need a reason why though. "
griffin,I identify as a gryphon after finding a certain click with the creature when I first found it and have stuck with it for years now. Traits that the gryphon carries as well are also ones I am usually passionate about and display.
dinosaur,"The meerkat, tasmanian tiger, dragon, iguanodon, wolf, etc. have all fascinated me. I've changed fursonas multiple times, so it's hard to say whether I stick with it. Currently, my fursona is a spider-monkey, wolf, tasmanian tiger hybrid. I identify with the wolf because I tend to howl and I like forests and the moonlight, as well as how 'spiritual' they seem and their pack structure. The spider-monkey, I tend to mimic 'monkey-like' noises and I can be pretty extatic- they've been a favorite when I was little as well. I even have a sock monkey named Squiggly. The tasmanian tiger; I've always loved cryptids, and they seemed pretty interesting. I love their long jaws their mysteriousness. "
wolf,Wolf Therianthrope
greyfox,There is no particular reason.
husky,I have a wolf soul in a human skin. 
otherfeline,"Feline Other for my totem animal Bobcat, bird other for my Phoenix fursonna I had that represented overcoming adversity (retired), and Other Neqa'El (Egyptian Demon Cat) for my current fursonna since I have a darker side and the side of me that gets infuriated if flesh and blood cats are mistreated. I demand respect for myself, others I love, and the animal I most identify myself with. "
wolf,"Not particularly. I like the coloration of Red wolves, and the history behind them is interesting."
dragon,Lots of heritage falls into the correlation with dragons as well as dragons always being my favorite thing since I was little.
collie,"Yes. I very much identify myself with the personality traits of that animal. From both the general sterotypes and the little details. I can't see myself as anything else, even another breed of dog, it wouldn't fit right."
tiger,I've always liked tigers. :3
otherungulate,"Damn it, Makyo, I've clicked on like fifty buttons already! I don't have time to write an explanation on goats!"

wolf,i've been around dogs my whole life
rat,"I had a handsome Russian Blue boy named Yoggie . Next to eating peas and pastas (and tearing down his brothers' nest to make his own), his favorite thing to do was to nap in my hoodie. He quickly became my writing companion, and while I loved all of my rats, he was especially precious to me. Unfortunately, he was also prone to respiratory issues and had very delicate health. His final illness led to a very fast decline. We fought very hard to save him - in fact, I only just paid off his vet bills, some three years after the fact.

I wanted something to commemorate my lovely boy, and to celebrate my love and support for rats - especially as I was no longer able to commit to fostering and volunteering at my local rat rescue. Because the loss was still so tender, I opted to make my character a Russian Silver, which was as close to a Blue as I was able to allow myself. I attributed all of his best personality traits and rattie habits to her, along with my own passion for writing and making ink-messes. "
lizard,"I'm lazy, like naps, and don't do alot xD"
wolf,i like both and my personality shares many similarities to these animals
lion,"Yes. Each animal retains traits of myself personally, or inherited traits of my parents, who related themselves to some of the animals as well (or really, really liked them)."
kitsune,I have always liked Japanese culture and history and I like being around humans as well as furs so what better than a Kitsune? There is also the magic of the Kitsune and the lore of their multiple tails. I can be a trickster and I like playing games. I identify with Tails the Fox.
rabbit,"similar characteristics, appreciation to soft things"
dragon,I've always been a fan of dragons and dragon fiction

"
dragon,"I admire the strengths of dragons -- they're powerful, loyal, and they command respect."
jackal,"Mostly in physical features, but I also share some behavioral attributes with the animals."
dragon,Silly question.
dragon,"One of us is a dragon otherkin. Another is an angelic humanoid who has a growing identifcation with gryphons and a gryphonesque alternate form (no personality or story attached, so not 'sona ...)"
dragon,"We are strongly dissociated identities, perceptual constructs running non-concurrently - we fabricate our avatars through the information within the shared portion of our memories to best represent what makes us, us. None of us have a human avatar, but some of us are so far out as to be constructs of superstring interactions or supercomputers. "
othercanine,No. 
otherbird,I like the species that I chose as my fursona- the attributes of the animal appeal to me and i try to bring them to life in what I do.
otherungulate,"My fursona is a donkey primarily because I was a fan of the transformation scenes in both Disney's Pinocchio, and the live-action Adventures of Pinocchio when I was a child. Being a fan of TF is partially what introduced me to Furry. I additionally chose a donkey because, like them, I have big ears. It's a way of poking fun at myself. I'm definitely not the most beautiful person, but I'll help you carry your burdens if you need someone to. "
arcticfox,"I really like foxes, but I also wanted to be a little different then the average fox of the fandom. It grew out of a bunch of things and now I'll do anything that has fox in it."

redfox,It fits me and my personality
otherfeline,"I've had my fursona thought out for years but never really matched it up with a species. She was always described as being a Folf Cat when she never looked work or dog like at all. So one day i discovered the Serval and have suck with it since then. Besides that tho I've also started to find my self acting more cat like instead of dog like if that makes sense. Just like movement, personality, and thought like i guess."

People assume I'm a lazy freeloader, but I'm not."
greyfox,Not really
riverotter,I believe I was an otter in a past life
lion,It just seemed to suit me.
otherfeline,"My personality best goes with cats and I tended to act like one somewhat even before finding the fandom. Also, since I love Pokemon I chose my favorite one, which still happens to be a feline, Mew."
wolf,"Grew up with and was around wolves, I feel a very close connection with them."
husky,"Not really, just enjoy huskies."
otherfeline,I've always felt especially close to cats and even have alot of cat-like habits.....and the species of cat i picked for my 'sona has always been my favorite species of cat since i was little.

domesticcat,"I feel like cats are mobile and fast, Cute and aggressive, Like wise my fursona is a Grey cat in the military, Something you usually don't see :3"
hyaena,"Partially because of certain colors and fur patterns, but also because of the personalities associated with these animals, in folklore especially."

wolf,"i feel that i was meant to be a wolf

otherdog,A long history of loving dogs as far back as early childhood.

polarbear,Works for me.
otherfox,best descriptor of my attributes as a person
otherfox,"Foxes have always been my favorite animal. They are always constructed as sly, clever, and mischievous all of which apply to me."
brownbear,I felt that I related best to stereotypical and modern societal portrayed behavior of said animal. 
tiger,"It represents the ideal body I woud like to have, were such things possible. "
snowleopard,"I mostly identify with wolf and tiger, but my identity of what I am changes with what moods I am in."

otherfox,Grew up in an area with a lot of foxes. Also I felt the my personality fit that of a fox.
arcticfox,No clear reason. I just feel a certain affinity towards said animal.
redfox,"Foxes are beautiful and have a playful sense about them.  I feel that many furs don't actually emulate the animals they pick but rather wish they could have more traits commonly associated with them.  For me, personally, I chose a fox as a type of fursona before even knowing for sure that it was a common species pick in the fandom."
wolf,"im a lone wolf, sometimes in packs, and when i hunt (fight) i toy with their minds in a way wolves usually would when hunting."
otherfeline,"I relate to many horrific creatures in the fandom, the the reason is, well, I feel like a monster. I don't identify with humans in any way, besides appearance. "

wolf,"Wolves have historically been and still are misunderstood creatures. Growing up with Asperger's before it was labeled in 1994, I felt misunderstood by many people. Occasionally, I still run into people who don't understand. "
dragon,I've always felt like some part of me is a dragon.
wolf,"Wolves are shy creatures, as I am. They are very family oriented, like I am, and not easily open to outsiders. They have a strength and beauty I admire and hope to have within myself, even if I can only wish for it."
othermustelid,Have always been told I was a Ferret/Raccoon so I became the Ferracoon.
wolf,i wish i was
wolf,"The Wolf is a leader and a pack animal, knowing how to treat its fellow wolves with respect while at the same time demanding respect in return. A wolf embodies the physical prowess and intelligence of a true hunter while he also exemplifies the honor and loyalty one would see in the knights of old. He stands tall, though he never forgets those he leads, aiding them to better work as a collective. My loyalty to those I hold dear is unwavering, my respect for those around me a gift given as our friendship is forged, and my willingness to aid others is an ever present aspect of my day to day life. This is why I consider myself a wolf: a beast of honor, loyalty, and respect."
redfox,"Because I feel like I'm just like a fox, I can be quite intelligent, and I'm often solitary."

redpanda,it was given to me by a friend who has been a furry for a long time 
wolf,I feel I share similar attributes to those of the wolf!
coyote,i just love those animals
otherbird,"Statistically, most furries choose their fursonas among species (or even creatures, like dragons) considered beautiful, powerful and/or charismatic. Personally, I can see the appeal, of course, but I also cannot see this as not being futile (in some cases, at least). I chose my fursona, a toucan, for personal symbolisms; even without being exactly beautiful or powerful or charismatic, it's how I would identify myself as an animal, regardless."
otherbear,"Because I been Identified  characteristics in the past, I been called Yogi or Booboo. I am big."
hyaena,"From The Lion King, my favorite character was Ed.  He had no lines, and all his expression was through various types of laughter.   He was very silly.  

I was on a Loin King BB back on Prodigy, and we all sort of picked characters from the movie, and I went with Ed.  Later on in life, I had to pick an email address, and I picked Ed.  

Then I became a furry.  The first furry I talked to asked me what I was.  This confused me a great deal!  They explained about furries picking a character or animal to identify with.  I went with hyena.  I have no regrets.

Alternate explanation:  ""Hyenas are terrible,smelly creatures, and someone has to love them."""
wolf,I feel that it represents some of my personalities.
weasel,"Yes. I am very ferret like and aspire to become the furfag personification of these divine, unique creatures...dooook doook !!! "
redfox,"All three because each suits my personality.
"

Feline, Tiger - because I run fast in real life;
Reptiloid, Dragon - because dragons are by far the most coolest animals ever existed;

tiger,Always have loved tigers. 
riverotter,I've been connected with otters all my life
wolf,"Yes

"
wolf,"I've drawn wolves since Preschool.  I have a chest in my garage of drawings I did as a very young child.  I identify with the wolf as my spirit guide and have been told the wolf is my spirit guide, based on sub-Druid belief.  Throughout highschool, every single art project involved a wolf somehow, some way."
arcticfox,"The general traits associated with foxes helped me create my fursona. Smart, quick thinkers, and they're much more social than I was at the creation of my fursona. My Fox has helped me to break out of my shell. I created my 'sona to push me to who I wanted to be, not who I was at the time."
kitsune,"I feel that it's a personality correlation. While foxes aren't my favourite animals, I find them witty and somewhat ridiculous. "
domesticcat,"I have many characteristics, tendencies, and preferences that are in synch with a domestic house cat, therefore leaving me to very strongly identify with this animal."
otherfeline,I thought it sounded neat and it sort of fit the character.
wolf,"I identify mostly with a wolf, but a crux is a mix hybrid and the animals its created out of relate to me strongly..."
otherfeline,I have cats as pets and they're really lovely and friendly beings. I'm also extremly friendly as them.
otherfeline,I like their anatomy and patterns and the sounds they make. 
otherbird,"I have always had a fondness for birds, I grew up with a book on birds and on the cover was a picture of a Northern Lapwing, so I based it off that as it is both aestheticly pleasing to look at and it holds sentimental meaning. I also love dragons and have done so for many years, so they have been COMBINED into one character. "
wolf,"I've loved those two animals since I was reeeeally young, so of course I'd want them as my 'sonas~"
wolf,"Chose Red Wolf (C. l. rufus) because the historical range matches up with where I live. I am very outdoorsy and could roam the woods for hours- I don't get squicked out by any animal, getting dirty, or hunting.
I'm told that I have a good singing voice and am a mix between an alto 1 and soprano 2. Wolves have always been held in regard for their deep howls, but the voice of a red is different than the average joe's grey.
I'm super shy, but I hold the friends I have very dearly to me and would kill for them.
I selected coywolf as there is much debate over the genetics and history of this species."
wolf,I like canines?? Exclusively?
snowleopard,"I share some common traits with my fursona's species. For instance I have a personality which mirrors that of a snow leopard, typically reserved and cautious. In addition to that, I share some physical traits with the other part of my fursona, an arctic fox, in that I would share a similar physique and physical mannerisms that would be similar to that of an anthropomorphic fox. In addition to that, I enjoy the snow and winter seasons, which explains why my fursona is a hybrid of a ""snow"" leopard and ""arctic"" fox, a species that I've named an Arctic Schnox."
germanshepherd,I like German Shepherds and I love dogs in general. I find they are easy to associate with and fun to play.
wolf,Not really.
wolf,its my spirit guide. i have a garudian who is a winged wolf.
arcticfox,"lean, thrives in the cold"
lion,"Actually, Lions are not my favourite animals (that would be Wolves). I can't offer you any other explanation for why I ticked Lion other than that is what I am. I am what I am even if I can't tell you Why I am."
lizard,"I love reptiles and dragons, they seem both the coolest animals to me, and they are the perfect icon of 'ugly' or 'monstrous' creatures being made beautiful in this fandom."
husky,"Confident, strong & playful things that i find hard to show in person."
riverotter,Otters are social! ^^
hyaena,its who i act like
tiger,"There is a reason why I identify with a Fox/Hedgehog/Tiger, but. when I try to elaborate on the reason, the reason makes no sense."
riverotter,"Because Otters are CUTE, and Lambs and Sheeps are CUTE. <3"
wolf,"-Always had a fascination for canines
-Connection with the moon"
dragon,The qualities and sheer type of being that I feel a dragon encompasses resonate to my innermost core.
wolf,I don't think any reason in particular. I just especially like and believe I have an affinity with wolves and dingos. 
otherdog,"I identify with my fursonas not because of the appearance, but how I feel that I connect with the animal, and how it reflects my personality."
snowleopard,"She's a wolf because they have in my life for as long as I can remember. I admire woves, they way I work with my family is basically living like a wolf pack, everybody has a role.
She's also a snow leopard mainly for physical attributes like being fluffy, having a long fluffy tail, sticky body, large paws, and small ears, which helps them live in cold weather I love colder weather. Plus I think leopards are cool.
Her birth form is a snow leolf but she has the abbility to shapeshift into any animal(anthro  aswell). Basically it gives me the excuse of changing her species and form. But I do love shapeshifters, especially werewolves"
seaotter,A strong attraction.
arcticfox,"I dunno, I guess not really. I just have a fascination with foxes and enjoy the cold. I also like a little variety, even though I'm not very creative, and I find arctic foxes are a bit rare-ish."
domesticcat,personal emotional experience
germanshepherd,"I feel close to the breed, And own a German Shepherd as well."
otherfeline,"Cats are agile, fast, and sneaky. They also seem quite intelligent in comparison to various species."
otherbird,Birds are free like I want to be. They can go anywhere they want with no troubles.
domesticcat,"I have always liked felines, and I feel that my personality would match that of a cat the most."
greyfox,"I've always like foxes since I saw Disney's Robin hood as a kid and dream that I was Robin. I identify with foxes in their intelligence, curiosity, and intellectual playfulness. At first I was leaning towards being a red fox, but I ended up choosing grey because they are more unique in the fandom, they are more shy in the wild (which I think fits my personality), and the fandom has fewer expected character roles for grey foxes, compared to red, so I would have an easier time making my character whatever I want him to be."
wolf,The Wolf is a atrong and majestic beast. I have always admired its beauty and its strength.
wolf,The lone wolf aspect.
coyote,"I've always been able to comfort to whatever social situation I'm in, and I've always had a mixed love of both natural and urban environments."
otherbear,He came to me in a dream.
bat,"My two 'sonas are mostly a way to represent my pseudo dual personality (Gemini sign thinguie, about being ""two-faced""). The bat, my first 'sona to date, used to be my own self years back, circa 04~06, when I was more serious and pessimistic with life in general.

I started using the mimiga 'sona when I begun to develop a cheerful, playful side (immature, even) after being in deeper contact with the furdon, and thanks to the support of a few anonymous furries back at '07s turn.

Since then, I've been used to represent myself using them both. My mimiga side, for when I'm being a big child, and my bat 'sona, for when I to act more like my age, more serious and responsible than what I prefer to be."
otherdog,"I find dalmatians especially attractive, also the comic lapping the competition was one of the first serious furry products i came in contact with and it pushed me into more of the furry world."
horse,"I feel that horses are strong and can show compassion and loyalty to their friends and loved ones, much like the way I do on a daily basis."
wolf,"They're what I am as Otherkin, transferred over to a fursona"
redfox,"The fox's cunning instincts resemble my own, and the solitary wolf is a metaphysical representation of myself "
husky,"No particular reason other than I like huskies (they are pretty dogs, I own a husky mix) and I think jackals are unique animals (I also enjoy learning about ancient Egyptian culture/mythology)."
husky,"Im very understanding and nice to people but if im pushed i am very aggresive,im also playful."
redfox,"yes, it reminds me of myself both in ways that I like and that I don't like. "
redfox,I feel linked to both these animals because they represent my personality.
wolf,"Indigenous to my area, appealing to my aesthetics, personality traits I have or want to have."
wolf,I like those animals.
wolf,Wolves are my favorite animal. They are beautiful to me.
dragon,Strangely it is simply a yes or no question:  Are you a dragon?  Yes.
wolf,I like them and I think they represent me well.
otherfox,Not exactly sure. Always liked foxes and such. Hard to explain as though it is a deep seeded feeling?
otherdog,"I like it when everyone is happy, I like to please people and make them happy/ proud of me. "
otherungulate,"Ungulates are rather under-represented in the fandom, so naturally I gravitate to sort of an ""underdog"" species. I am also a vegetarian so I associate more with herbivores than carnivores. "
tiger,"Strong attraction to the ideal of feline agility, power and strength. Specific mental ""pull"" towards tigers from a very young age. It just ""felt right"", though not in an otherkin kind of way."
wolf,"Wolfs are proud a lot like the charicter I make, also there is a alpha, beta etc social standing with my charicters

And they look awesome :D"
lion,"Leonine Personality - strength and firece when provoked / threatened, but otherwise willing to just let things be. Tribbles love food; what's not to admire there?"
riverotter,"I feel that I share traits with both animals, I also find them very attractive both sexualy, and in a platonic way. "
coyote,"My time as a coyote is as long as my time in the fandom. My nature is coyote-ish: opportunist, amoral, survival-oriented, a bit on the flippant and humorous side. And canids are just my 'thing.'"
husky,"Furry, cute , playful, sneaky, good tracker, belongs to pack, friendly to pack, adaptable, agile"
lion,"Astrologically I was born a Leo, although I don't put any stock in astrology. I find I identify with some of the positive, and even some of the negative, traits attributed to lions. And when I let my hair grow out, it naturally came out rather flowing and mane-like."
lizard,I´ve always loved reptiles.
jackal,"General perception of jackals being tricky, sly, cunning things, often with an evil tone and their perceived ""lone wolf"" lifestyle. Also some physical traits, such as slender physique."
wolf,Reflective of personality in relation to the species behaviour.
wolf,"Jasper's a fun loving, wily and resourceful, attention seeking coyote/wolf hybrid with a nose for adventure and roast chicken. Exploding into reality like a locomotive on speed, Jasper is my connection to that magical place grown-ups call the imagination! 

There isn't anything particularly special about Jasper's looks. He is what he is, and he does what he does. But he does it with a grin on his face and a song in his heart. Jasper's happy and content with himself, his surroundings, and everything he does. There isn't much that happens that can make him angry or upset. Some would call Jasper a slacker, others would call him what ever they like. The point is Jasper is better then all of that. He doesnt need to look or sound special to feel apreciated. He can see it in the things he does!"
wolf,I am this animal inside.
dragon,"Dragon, specifically a red dragon, because:
I utterly detest cold. Cold is bad.
I hoard things.
I tend to be possessive of things, especially that which I hold dear.
I have an affinity with fire
I breath fire (No, I'm not joking.)
"
wolf,"I am an excellent hunter, when I function in an operation I work with my pack, and I dont attack until attacked."
raven,I admire the cunning and intelligence of the raven.
wolf,"I love wolves... What I do not see in humans, I see in them. Their lives seem so much better than the way most people live. It's so simple."
hyaena,"I love Wolves, Foxes, Coyotes and all Dogs. I also love Cows, as my mate has a Cow fursona."
dragon,Yes
snowleopard,"Solitairy, isolated, mis-understood and rare to find."
raccoon,I feel that raccoons are the best non-feline animal.
lion,"I am a huge lion-lover. I love what they stand for, being courage, strength, etc., traits everyone loves. "
othermustelid,"Otters are fun and playful, but they have a lot of human-like qualities, such as emotion and complex teamwork. They can also be vicious and unpredictable, and the Marine Otter is a lesser-known species; I feel sometimes that I enjoy being out of the spotlight and in the background where I am comfortable, yet at the same time I am not afraid to be the center of attention if I deserve it. "
otherfeline,"They evolve from shinx at level 18 (or age 18 for me), and I've always seen the kid inside of me a shinx and the luxray/luxio what i look like on the outside. Its also a symbol for my own mental conflict. The inside, which is nice, caring, and quiet, is a shinx, and the outside is angry, depressed, strong, big, and unsure of anyone, like a luxray. The Luxray is my outside body, the weightlifting man, and the shinx is the kid deep inside"
skunk,"Cat, I'm extremely loyal and loving to thous I trust."
otherfeline,More personality similarities than I can count.
domesticcat,"I've always been around cats my entire life and loved them, and my personality fits into the mold perfectly too, along with loving the appearance."
redfox,I feel that my personality most closely resembles the fox.
husky,The animal I chose was due to my love and adoration for the animal.
lion,"I tend to associate lions with humbleness, wisdom, and dormant strength. They might be active or lazy from one moment to the next, and I see them being casual lovers, usually on the dominant side but not minding some dominance from their partner.. Also, I used to have quite long hair and although it's short now, it's still enough I can associate with a mane."
bat,my fursona is an elephant-bat solely because I enjoy elephants and bats.
otherdog,"I chose corgi to represent my personality because there are many personality qualities that we share in common from the quirkiness, to sarcastic, to lazy."
lizard,All are parts and pieces of my Therianthropy. Moth is my totem animal.
wolf,I identify with the animals above as a therian so that is how I am most comfortable way to represent myself in the furry fandom
otherfeline,"to be specific, my fursona is a feline alien. i have always loved cats and i have always felt a special connection towards space which is why this is my fursona's species"
otherfeline,My mannerisms reflect that of a feline than any other creature. 
polarbear,I like polar bears.
arcticfox,Foxes are my favorite animal.
otherfox,"I see the animals instincts in myself.
"
otherdog,I just feel that the two that I picked represent me the best when I roleplay.
wolf,"I am fiercely loyal to my friends and loved ones and have always called them my pack.  I'm a prior Marine and so, I'm trained to stalk and hunt down my enemies. And, I've always had a deep respect for wolves."
raccoon,No. It's just cute.
othermarsupial,"Dragons are fun because you can do anything with them, I have a dragon/roo character. My first character was a pitbull. The character that is the most 'me' is a Tasmanian devil - short, chubby, bad temper."
husky,more of a dog person 
redfox,Totem descriptions and common media tropes. Kitsune lore.
redpanda,Choose them for my Fursona.
germanshepherd,My personality matches almost perfectly with that animal.
domesticcat,Because cats are awesome!!!!!
redfox,Attributed characteristics in Western folklore; specifically intelligence and sneaky/crafty behavioural traits.
dragon,"Wolf's Leadership, Dragons's Power and Shark's Senses"
otherdog,"My personality; people have told me my behaviour is almost dog-like, even before I discovered the Furry Fandom... My general attitude towards life, comforting people and the likes. The wolf part being that I was alone for a long time in my life, or at least it felt like it, and also for the loyalty to my new-found friends and family."
domesticcat,"I have grown up around cats all my life. Though not terribly so, I consider myself to have some cat-like characteristics."
otherreptile,"I love reptiles, they are so ancient and wonderful. Mine particularity is a mutt created myself, so its very personal and pretty much an alternate me. "
otherdog,"My fursona is a pitbull because they are big, muscular dogs that are often unfairly stereotyped as being vicious and mean when they are in fact quite derpy and sweet when one gets over their fears and gets to know the dog, and that is something that I feel I kind of poke at when total strangers feel intimidated by me for no apparent reason until they get to know me and I'm basically dumb and drool all over them and just wanna play fetch or something. :B"
coyote,"'Tis my theriotype.  I've made throwaway characters of many different species, though, but this is the one I always identify my true self as."
domesticcat,"I have loved cats for my whole life. They match my personality, I guess."
otherfox,I chose to be a Jeweled fox basing it off my love of gems and Shippo from InuYasha. I created the Jeweled fox myself.
otherdog,I always have enjoyed and loved dogs and my favorite dogs are huskies and golden retrievers. 
husky,"I chose a husky because I always felt familiar with these dogs. Since the day I saw one of these, I felt like I was connected to them, as if I was part of their family. Since then, my fursona was and will always be a husky!"
seaotter,"I chose the sea otter because I felt a connection with the animal. To me sea otters have a nurturing quality that I feel is something I would want to convey to others and since they are a species native to California, I felt it was fitting. Sea otters are also very fascinating creatures that I would never have come to know more about if I had not taken the time to read about them prior to choosing my fursona. "
riverotter,"They're local to my area, and they're just so darn cute!"
otherbear,"Yes, the black bear seems to fit my personality traits the best."
redfox,I grew up with foxes in the woods behind my house and was always fascinated with the sounds of the cubs playing and the vixens screeching for a mate.
otherfox,Fox is what fits me the best and I've always felt like one.
domesticcat,Matching personalities. Similar behaviour and an easier character immersion in RP contexts
husky,"wolf, and husky  seem to have a kinship with me  as far as  thy go they just seem to like and get me , as for Squirrels . . . I'm a bit of a horder  with movies  games and  food  and Squirrels  do horde food .  ( and again  they seem to like me in the wild ) "
dragon,"I feel a slight sort of bond with the dragon type... My mother loves dragons, and I have grown up reading ""Dragonriders of Pern"" and literature such as that...

...That and I have a bit of a hoarding ""thing"", especially with some things... ^^'''"
greyfox,I love foxes. They're my favorite animal and I identify with them most. 
tiger,"My fursona is actually a Beige fox, the reason I identify with it is primarily because it's noctornal and what I see the furry fandom as being ""the general populus"" and relatively intelligent. Though I find myself wanting to change over to a tiger, as that is my favourite animal."
domesticcat,"I like the independence and loner qualities of both the cat and dragon. I like the grace and playfulness of a cat, but the wisdom and ferocity of a dragon."
otherdog,Theriotypes and natural/aesthetic appeal.
wolf,"Many including personal, heraldric, mythic, symbolic, and enjoyment based."
greyfox,"Dragons: They can be bizarre, intriguing, mysterious, curious and well informed. A dragon is a fantastic creature defined only by the limits of our imaginations as sentient beings. However, their most prevalent guise is that of a formidable, free, intelligent and willful creature. I identify with that primary description of a dragon - never backing down from things I feel justified in pursuing, living my life how I desire and without fear of judgment from others, pursuing intellectual concepts such as philosophy and the art of words and upholding my morals and feelings with the utmost confidence in them.

While I may be no high-flying, fire-breathing, ass -kicking monster of a reptile, I try my best to be strong and proud of who I am. Praising and criticizing myself where needed. All of the other animal selections pale in comparison to how accurately the dragon personifies me.

The Fox: It personifies my cleverness and my abilities to adapt to any environment or situation with relative ease. I seem to be targeted or sought after for some of my characteristics and interests, much like the fox is targeted for its hide and value as a pet. The fox was actually my very first fursona! But not my first furry OC. In fact, truth be told, I was involved in the furry fandom since childhood and I never knew it! But back then, a dragon was my only character.

Dinosaur, Theropod: I particularly identify with the Theropods for many of the same reasons as dragons. Power, willfulness, cleverness and freedom. However, as we all know, creatures like Tyrannotitan and Allosaurus were far from friendly, or even reasonable; certainly unable to commune or cooperate with the general masses of humanity for the most part. Hence their back seat to dragons.

Alligator: I chose this species for their power and willfulness. Alligators, as with many species, are quite suppressed by humanity and, therefore, are not as free as a dragon or a dinosaur - which (generally) have no fear of or never had to deal with humans, respectively."
hyaena,"Hyenas are fiercely independent, and also pack animals at the same time. Female spotted hyenas are dominant, but I chose to be a striped hyena because they mate for life. Also, my bite is just as strong as my bark. "
wolf,"Their simbilise all I hold dear loyalty, strength, truth. Pluse their beautiful"
lizard,The characteristics represents different aspects of my own life.
otherfox,I think that black foxes and dragons are an interesting species.
pandabear,"Dragons and Dinosaurs, because I always had a fascination for them even when I was younger. 
If I asked certain friends or family members, they would identify me as either a Panda, Rabbit or Squirrel.
The rat is somehow special to me, yet I still have to figure out why. Perhaps because his characteristics and physical 'problems' resemble mine -such as Hypermobility-."
raptor,I choose species over the symbolism and characteristics/trait of the animal and by how much it relates with my personality.
otherdog,personality
panther,yes
domesticcat,"I've always liked cats and spent a lot of time around them my entire life. They are special to me and I feel like I sometimes share personality traits with cats in general, so it seemed normal. "
snowleopard,"I strongly relate with the snow leopard, as my main, partially because I am fair skinned and am rather small yet stout. I have smaller features but am strong. Also, I enjoy lazing about when I can but do enjoy being outside in the sun and being active."
wolf,A strong interest in werewolves when i was younger that eventually merged into the furry fandom
otherbear,Built like a bear
wolf,"I love dogs, and wolves, leading me to an attachment for them, and a desire to shape my fursona around my image of them,"
redfox,N/A
domesticcat,"Feline characteristics are a mix of what I see in myself currently (cuddly, flexible, precocious) and what I would desire to have (grace, pride).  I am frequently described as cat-like by non-furry friends."
wolf,Personal traits and behaviours
weasel,their size and placement in the animal kingdom
wolf,I find myself drawn towards the animals listed above because I believe that they embody different aspects of my personality. 
otherungulate,"I like all ungulates but I like goats a lot, and they fit my personality."
panther,Panthers are athletic animals and i participate in athletic activities
wolf,"Spiritually, I more closely identify with the wolf. I see many wolf characteristics in myself. 
As for Moose, I've always had a fondness for them. They are my favorite plush toys and they are just so darned cute. "
raptor,Always thought Birds were cool looking.
deer,I chose deer because it fits both my personality and physique and physical style.
wolf,"Always have. Yearn for the pack hierarchy, and am very pleased when in a proper Beta role. Like a canine, I am most happy when Alpha is pleased back with me, in most contexts. Relations with parents, coaches, instructors, superiors, significant other, etc. I WANT them to be proud of me, their 'top dog.'

Not quite as domesticated as other canine breeds, yet not an 'alpha-male' desiring dominance."
wolf,"i love the wolf for its beauty and strength, i feel somewhat linked to wolves."
tiger,The husky is a beautiful animals and the tiger is my sprital guide
redfox,"Raccoon and fox= mischievous and resourceful
Wolf= loyal and other reasons"
skunk,"As a skunk, I find symbolism in the black/white color scheme of the animal."
wolf,Unexplainable affinity. 
bat,Spiritually
wolf,Pack mentality.
husky,Husky because I adore cold weather.
othermustelid,Feel I have the traits for both particular species. Personality and physical wise to a certain degree.
wolf,"I find myself just always drawn to wolves, especially when it comes to the pack and such group things
"
wolf,"Wolf therianthrope (basically the otherkin community)
My fursona does not reflect how I see my ""wolf self"" but it made sense for me to choose a wolf fursona."
dragon,"I'm part of the whole 'Otherkin' troupe, In fact I was one before the term was even coined.  With this in mind, I follow the belief of being a Dragon in a previous life."
otherfox,They are the type of animals I wish I were kinda like in some way.
husky,"It's because I am extremely energetic, playful, and loyal as well as a fun person to be around and generaly a nice person. Which is what huskies seem like to me."
jackal,I identify with a jackal and fox hybrid because I admire the ferocity of jackals and their place in mythology. Foxes I find adorable and are interesting in how they can be so similar in attitude to felines.
husky,"closest domestic relative to wolves, I enjoy the wildness, but also tend to be loyal, maybe to a fault"
wolf,"loyalty, friendship, honor amoung friends.  all traits I admire in other humans as well."
husky,"They're my favorite animals and since I like to draw them, I made my fursona out of it. Therefore, being used to having a husky as a fursona I identify with it, but it is not very similar to my personality."
riverotter,"My personality matches what I think an otter's personality would be like.
I've always liked otters."
greyfox,I have a spiritual connection to wolves.
snowleopard,no reason
rabbit,I just like bunnies
snowleopard,It fits my personality.
arcticfox,My last name means Fox and I always thought they were different from other animals growing up.
dinosaur,"Velociraptor, seemed closest fitting to my personality and nuances.
"
kitsune,"I act quite like a wolf, but at other times I am a lot like a kitsune."
wolf,It is the only one of its kind in the fandom
otherfeline,Yes.
tiger,"One of the reasons I believe I have a strong connection to white tigers is 
1) I am not lithe and have alot of physical body problems, I am also a very tall and large person. My fursona is the complete opposite, a lithe and quick, steady on their paws tiger.
2) White specifically is what I gauge to be the most innocent of colours, and my fursona is very innocent and 'cute'."
otherfox,"Well, I've always been around a fox, my pet Maggie is a fox and with my parents in the military I spent more time learning from her growing up then from humans, so I believe I am a fox "
otherdog,I like their looks. I feel a mental kinship to them.
dragon,"It's a mix of interest in animalistic traits, how Dragons are seen as possibly intelligent, and most straightforwadly that I am more interested in dragon-like traits than I am when it comes to other animals."
greyfox,Its the way I feel
cheetah,"I like cheetahs because they are not the strongest or the bravest, but they still get things done in a world where they are not dominant."
snowleopard,always loved it 
kangaroo,"My main one Raccoon because Raccoon characters  in cartoons and other anthro media are stereotyped typed as lower class slums poor, dirty and unkept witch fits my person perfectly. "
bat,"Flying, nocturnal, cute mammal."
jackal,Wolf because i just feal that it is me
panther,Its just what I've always felt fit me.
tiger,The attributes of this animal are awe inspiring!
snowleopard,"I have feline attributes similar to a housecat but I enjoy the winter and the snow, I define myself as a house kitty snow leopard type thing."
skunk,"I identify with a skunk because of a family pet I had as a child. Fiercely protective and aggressive toward strangers but easily swayed to your favor if you gave it ample love and affection. As I grew, I adopted a similar state of mind and when I decided to embrace the furry lifestyle, I thought there no other possibility than a skunk. "
husky,"First Fursona - Liger. Most guys here are dogs/wolves and I don't really fit in. I wanted stripes and a mane.

Second Fursona - Husky. Generic, adorable, playful"
kitsune,too long and too boring to fit in here. mostly just small personality quirks and allergy jokes
hyaena,"Aardwolf Hyenas looks fit my personality, and I'm unique and different like I feel hyenas are to the fandom."
raven,"A crow is socially detached, it observes mankind atrocities from the high and it isn't corrupted by them. A crow is socially selective, it judges zealously which individuals can enjoy his company. A crow is individually thoughtful, it's a researcher of the celestial truth."
wolf,"Wolf are social animals with strong hierarchy, they are strong and beautiful to see."
otherfox,There are several traits that the animal has that similar to my personality. 
dragon,I have always loved dragons. Just the magic and the mystery behind them has always peaked my interest.
lion,"I'm a Leo, and have always loved lions in general."
wolf,No particular reason.
rabbit,"I read a lot of Redwall as a kid, and the hares / Long Patrol were always my favorite critters / emblematic of how I choose to live. I also like how they're portrayed in art (as opposed to bears or rabbits). "
kitsune,i tend to have more of this animals personality than any other.
leopard,I just felt a connection to the animal when I saw them
wolf,"I find wolves to be rather noble creatures, despite them being potentially dangerous and vicious animals. But i admire the traits exhibited by the wolf. And i think they look lovely"
tiger,"fascination, childhood exposure"
othercanine,"They're willowy and flamboyant looking, like a kind of canine drag queen or super model. I have a strong interest in gender ambiguity and fashion, so that sort of quality appeals to me."
rabbit,"Rabbit/Hares are very paranoid as I am, they love lettuce (heads of lettuce are one of my favorite snacks.) They are quick thinking and quick on their feet as well, they listen and observe their surroundings often. Hares often live alone/prefer to be alone."
tiger,"When I chose my fursona, I was more of a quiet person generally, but now I've changed to being a bit more social. However, I love my little fursona guy way too much to ever change him (even though I only gave him a personalizedname a couple days ago). Additionally, tigers have always been my favorite animal(s?) because they are extremely beautiful, strong, and graceful."
kitsune,"I identify with foxes in general becuase all my life, I have been smaller than others, and have had to use my mind to garner any social status."
otherfeline,"Among many I have chosen, they reflect how I see a perception apart of myself and my interaction with others."
otherfox,Because it just feels like the right choice... And foxes are my favorite animal. ^w^
deer,"The personalities are fitting for me, especially if you go off the native american Totem meaning of the animals. "
coyote,I admire Quallities of the animals personality
dinosaur,Seeing Jurassic Park (specifically the raptors in the movie~) back when it debuted in theaters struck a very strong chord and I have identified with them ever since.
cougar,Like them and have seen a past incarnation as a cougar.
redfox,shy lonely small playfull
germanshepherd,their fur pattern looks cool
tiger,Transitioning from wolf to a more solitary animal in the tiger.
cougar,Native to my country/cultural significance.
mouse,"It's not that I identify with it. It's well, here's the beginning. For a long time, I thought it would be cool if my persona was an anthro but I could never pick an animal. When I started drawing for the furry fandom, I thought that it would be more appropriate and almost necessary that I have a furry fursona. I wanted something that could fly, but no bird species caught my interest, my bug anthro designs didn't have the look I wanted, I wasn't cool enough for a dragon, a sylph is not anthro in my mind, and other flying creatures I felt just plain clashed with my personality. Then, I thought that I could definitely make being a skunk work, but it would be weird since the first erotic drawing I uploaded was of a skunk anthro.

So I doodled and doodled ideas, trying to narrow things down. I wasn't quite satisfied, so I took a quiz out of part boredom, part curiosity, and part hope that it would help me out. I ended up with a mouse. OK whatever. I wasn't satisfied. It would feel weird having a mouse fursona anyway because of the spiritual meaning I see it having in a lot of eastern artwork. I went around online, trying to see what everyone else was doing even though I knew I wasn't the type to just pick whatever someone else was doing. I eventually decided to take another quiz but from a website where I could see all the possible results afterwards. Maybe they somehow have something listed that I hadn't thought of. I was going to just take the quiz and put random answers but I ended up answering questions pretty honestly. And I ended up with the mouse again. I entertained the thought a bit more this time, seeing as the internet apparently wants me to be a mouse. I saw how it could possibly suit me, looked up a few photos of field mice, shrugged, and went with it.

I have a strange, foolish fearlessness for a mouseboy, though. And I still wanted my persona to be able to fly. So, part western dragon my fursona became (even though my imagination somehow made it so that dragonmouse was only a secondary form that my mouse didn't like very much and he still couldn't fly very well when he takes it. Psfth, imagination ruins all the fun.)
And that's my fursona story. Nothing spiritual. Nothing fancy. Just a fun chance at using my imagination and a very fun chance to design an anthro character."
lizard,"I always like lizards in some way with their hard but smooth scales, long tongues, and interesting anatomy. Other then that something in me tells me that I would love nothing other than to be a walking lizard."
wolf,"I didn't choose the thug life, the thug life chose me."
wolf,"They are sometimes misunderstood, feared and even thought of as loners, but are actually very social creatures"
dragon,Dragons have always interested me and my personal character fits best with a dragon form.
wolf,Loyalty to my pack
redfox,I identify with the particular traits of the fox
dragon,I associate myself with the animals I have chosen above. I find traits or extreme spiritual connections to these animals.
dragon,Looks
dragon,Strong connections to a past life as this animal.
dragon,"Horse - I like muscle body and their nature's freedom. 
Dragon - I love their wings and powerful."
redfox,"I feel that my personality matches with that of a fox, and my name, Todd, in Latin means fox."
husky,Just like it :)
redfox,Agility
wolf,I've always felt a connection with canines. I've always had a pack mentality and am really loyal to friends and family. I've yet to find my true canine fursona.
husky,"Originally, I came over to furry from the scifi/gaming shore, and my previous character is a robot based on the movie Red Planet that I came up with way back in school (8+ years ago). It represents to me determination, effectiveness and independence. And a certain kind of elegance in all that, that I'd characterize as having a feline touch. A lot of things have changed in my life since then. I've moved out, started studying at the university, and also began to re-evaluate a lot of my views on life. The above still remain valuable qualities to me. However when the time came that I decided to make a furry character of my own, I didn't want to just have the same character twice. I wanted a character that can be both energetic and stubborn, but also loyal, friendly, silly and a bit on the hyper side. The decision to go for a husky specifically was totally spontaneous while idly reading various species-related articles on wikifur and wikipedia."
raccoon,They're fluffy and have awesome markings on their faces and tails.
rabbit,"rabbits are known to be delicate, frightful , aggressive when needed(at least some of them) , full of energy"
wolf,I love the chase. That deep primal feeling I get 
dragon,"Physically, my family has a trait of longevity and having a high pain tolerance which would describe a dragons near immortality and scale armor. I find myself to be wiser and a little more intelligent then the average person as well as stubborn which I find matches a dragons personality and mental traits. I also am spiritually aloof and don't get too tied down to doctrines of religion while at the same time showing respect for its structure. This might describe me being celestial in nature paying attention to the big picture instead of down to earth and paying attention to details."
coyote,"Skittish, trickster, anvils on the head coyote."
lizard,"I tend to be drawn to them naturally, and can only ever imagine myself as one of them."
jackal,"I made out an algorythm which I fed with a graph representing my family tier combined with classic characterization based off Aesops tales. In the second stage, after the probability per species was determined, I took the most dominant one and used the percentage of the other possibilites as tokens/points and adjusted the character randomly. After that, I modeled the character data with a limited amount after my current biological state. Since the mental state does not influence much I passed on that topic.

TL;DR: Math"
rabbit,"No
"
hyaena,My sister and I both identify as Striped Hyenas. We laugh a little bit like hyenas.
coyote,"Not really, everyone wants to be a fox, which kinda ruined the experience of having a fox as a character. Coyotes are similar, except bigger and not as fucking cliche'. "
lion,"Because wolves symbolize brotherhood. Lions symbolize courage. And plus, wolves are so CUTE!!!"
skunk,Yes
othercanine,I've always identified with canines because I just believe that I am like a canine in a lot of ways. But my main fursona is a vampire/werewolf hybrid because I've also always been interested in vampires and werewolves.
tiger,"Mainly due to the Totemic animals (emotions and personality).
Tiger is the one that most resembles to match my personality."
wolf,They present traits that I have or want to have.
coyote,Religious reasons.
othercanine,"I am both sociable, and self-sufficient."
kitsune,I chose a kitsune because its demeanor is closely associated with my own.
otherreptile,I don't know just do
othercanine,"well I have some fursona from my young childhood but my main one is a arctic wolf,dragon hybrid

I choose this species because I love wolves and dragons from the start, also the color red, black and white.

to make it simpler, I mix it up and got a arctic wolf that has small horn behind his ears and has a favor for red and black clothings."
otherfox,Fennecs are playful small creatures who are very edgy and always alert and moving. I can relate to this. They're also super cute :D
othercanine,"As long as I can remember, I've felt a sense of (be)longing with canines and otters, separately but simultaniously. I can't explain it, because maybe I'm not sure, but I think I see them as better beings than humans."
domesticcat,Just feel close to cats
hyaena,"Hyenas are the coolest, yo."
grizzlybear,"My weight, body hair, fondness for cuddling and closeness."
rabbit,"The bat is my namesake, as my initials spell BAT, and I strongly believe that the rabbit/hare is my spirit or guide animal."
deer,"Yes. There are physical similarities (slenderness) as well as similarities in perceived (archetype) temperament. After some thinking shortly after finding the fandom, I was leaning of identifying with deer. The fact that my mother (not knowing anything about furry or that I identified with animals) spontaneously decided that I ""must have been a deer in a previous life"" sealed the deal."
redfox,"I don't suppose so; I was caught on a blog about (real) foxes when friends decided to help me clean out my tabs. They found it amusing, so I went with it and became outwardly enamored with foxes, looking up their pictures at every opportunity around them, much to their dismay. When I created a character on FurryMUCK, I made it a fox.

TL;DR - Caught looking at foxes, went with it."
domesticcat,"I've always been a fan of cats, I think they make good household companions and they seem like interesting animals. Seemed like a good chunk of typical 'cat attributes' applied to me too, so I figured it made sense."
raptor,"Yes. I have always found birds of prey fascinating, and have always been obsessed with dragons. I've also had an attraction to wolves, werewolves and foxes. These animals incorporate some ideals of mine (namely; speed, intelligence and dexterity over brute strength).
I tried making an animal that incorporated all of the above, and I found it looked like a griffin without wings, which is a great metaphor for freedom long sought (flight for the animal, being that animal for me)."
otherdog,"Ethiopian wolf - symbolically relates to my personality and outlook
African wild dog - used for aesthetic reasons only"
coyote,"One is a role model to me - the animal has traits I admire and hope to inspire in myself. It's a symbol for who/what I want to be. The other has traits (not always desirable) that I have too, so it's more like a symbol of who I am."
wolf,"The animal characteristics fit my personality or has characteristics that I would like to develop. E.g. Being more outgoing, being more assertive."
riverotter,"It just feels right.

That, and I admire their personality and natural attributes.

Additionally, while growing up I was heavily influenced by works such as Brian Jacques' Tales of Redwall."
wolf,Yes. I just feel a connection with them in terms of personality traits and a spiritual connection with wolves.

wolf,It's mu soul animal
redfox,I <3 foxies
collie,"I love dogs, and my breed is a mix of Border Collie and Corgi because I own a border collie and I'm short like a corgi."
snowleopard,"Tiger's are my favourite animals, followed by all felines.
And I wanted to design a bird character so I am in the process of writing it up."
wolf,"I am a wolf/vampire hybrid and i feel like it connects to me because im timod but can become vicious quickly. Plus, i am protective of my friends and a wolf symbizes a part of a pack."
lion,It just happened. :/ ?
dragon,Just feels right.
dragon,"I consider myself Otherkin, such that my spirit or soul is that of a dragon, and that I possibly was one is a previous life."
otherdog,"A dog has a raw, unbridled sexuality that I find alluring."
leopard,Varied reasons for all. 
otherfox,"My 'sona is a pretty generic looking, brown fox. Generic species as well! I identify with her as I feel that I myself am very generic and nothing very special to look at. "
tiger,I identify with these animals due to a mutt-like mix traits of myself and characteristics of these animals I perceive in myself and that others perceive in me.

dragon,Yes.
leopard,"My personality, and my cuddlyness."
coyote,I just like coyotes =]
greyfox,"I feel that I relate to that animal the most, plus foxes are damn cool. Also foxes are common, and maybe I like them because I don't want to be uncommon."
arcticfox,I am manipulative and mostly solitary. Loyal to those I can trust and no one else. Clever.
wolf,Its fur color
lizard,"Based off of a char from a long D&D campaign. Came to identify with the char from having to RP it a lot, so I use it as a Fursona when needed, although I don't identify with the concept of a Fursona and so don't often use or think of it."
kitsune,"Never been quite sure why - just had an interest in Kitsune that won't really go away, and I think the legends and such are pretty interesting."
rat,Its natural characteristics are like my own.
wolf,Spirituality
wolf,"The wolf has always been my favorite animal. (Don't worry, not a wolfaboo! :D)
Idk really, I've just had my fursona for basically years and years. Before I had any knowledge of what a furry even was. Probably since age 6.  
Just fun! And I love my fursona, That's all there is too it! <3"
tiger,They look fascinating and beautiful
wolf,"I actually just think that wolves are cute as well as cool. They appeal to me a great amount. At least, a lot more than any other animal."
riverotter,Personality and lore associated with the otter fits my personality and my chosen presentation.
redfox,"Because they're so, oberly cute, duh."
wolf,I find them interesting.
germanshepherd,I'm sexually attracted to canines and I base my fursona and character as a hybrid of my beautiful Shepherd and myself.
wolf,"The reason I identify with wolves is how I react in situations, I feel as though the way I act, as myself, are a lot how wolves react. I travel in a small pack of friends, its hard to gain our trust, we care and help eachother out, we're lovable but fierce.
As a child, I lived near the woods, and everynight I'd fall asleep listening to wolves howling to the moon. I think just the chills I got down my spine everytime I heard wolves howl is what really attracted me to taking a wolf as my character."
lizard,"Probably, but I don't know what it is..."
hyaena,"I have a very strange laugh, which I am often ridiculed for outside of the furry fandom.
Since Hyenas are also known for their laugh, I connected with them.

wolf,Share similar social traits and I think they look nice.
dragon,I feel as if i am one biologicly
otherfeline,"I've always likes cats as pets, seems right to choose so."
otherdog,"No real reason, I just have an interest."
husky,"I've always adored wolves, when i was young, i wished so much to have one knowing honestly it would be impossible to keep. On my 8th birthday my parents got me a Siberian Husky and ""Hunter"" has been apart of my life ever since."
husky,the wolf is my spirit animal and the husky is my favorite domestic k9
husky,"Huskies are both dogs playful, yet closer to wolves hard working "
domesticcat,"The Warriors book series, mostly. My character isn't of that world or culture, but it did confirm my love for cats. 

Also, real cats are snuggly, fun to play with, and I'm a fan of the concept of purring."
dragon,"I believe it accurately matches my personality. Dragons are strong, but don't have many friends. They are extremely loyal, and will always defend what is important to them. And they like shiny stuff. :D"
wolf,The wild freedom it represents
raptor,"The owl is my current spiritual guide.  I have always shared a special connection with owls, alongside my admiration for them."
domesticcat,"Fan of cats, anthropomorphic and otherwise; consider the facet of my personality that most closely related to being a furry to be like a cat."
othermarsupial,Yes. Before I was a furry I did my own personal research on it. It seemed to fit my personality and my knowledge on the animal makes me identify with it more.

skunk,I'm messy

kitsune,Always had some strong affinity for dolphins. Like a spirit animal or totem.
wolf,No.
bat,"Most of all I wanted something that very few people were used to seeing in the fandom,  also my fursona had to be emotional and not a constant. Very fluid in expressions. So I took an exceptionally long time in trying to decide but in the end I like the creepy cuteness of chiroptera"
domesticcat,"After years of analyzing my personality and behavior, i realized it resembled cats in several aspects - and some friends agreed with it. Also, I love cats, both the real and the anthropomorphic ones."
dragon,I just like them a lot :>
jackal,I have family from the area that jackals are native to.
greyfox,A
wolf,I am mostly like these animals and I also have a strong connection with them
otherfox,"Silver fox: Due to it's uniqueness. Fox exhibits a certain level of craftiness, though while the weaker of the canine species, they tend to be resourceful. I also find foxes to be aesthetically pleasing, curious, entertaining creatures that have certain traits that I would like to exhibit myself."
redfox,I love foxes
husky,"Because I feel it suits me the most, and my boyfriend is."
husky,I have always liked huskies and they seem to fit my personality well.
horse,characters I have created.
dragon,"I love dragons since I was very little, and one time I tried to imagine myself, the dragoness appeared."
wolf,"There are somewhat consistent, mythological traits usually applied to the animals I have selected. I appreciate, admire, or possess these traits. "
germanshepherd,"I'm a zoophile attracted to canines, and my own lover is a German Shepherd."
coyote,"Coyotes usually remain unseen, and by the public are rarely mentioned (as compared with wolves). They are mostly quiet except when speaking at night to other coyotes.

I myself am rarely fully acknowledged by my peers, and usually speak only to my fellow ""coyotes"" (outsiders, geeks, nerds, whatever word fits for such groups)."
riverotter,"Have you ever taken an nap outside under or in a tree? If not you should. 
Also. Water. swim. love it. 
"
wolf,"Wolf - I feel I am more of a loner, with a specific 'Pack' of friends, and being a grey wolf just feels natural to me."
wolf,"No special reason, I just really like wolves."
hyaena,"It's comfortable. It's not my favorite species, but I like it well enough. I wanted something comfortable, not something I found super-sexy."
dragon,I choose dragon because the represent power and strength. As me being in the U.S Army I have the strength to do things most people cant. Also its just been something that has fascinated my mind for 9 years.
riverotter,Share personality traits and I've always liked otters.
redfox,"Yes, spiritual.
I once had a dream that felt very real in which I encountered a fox in the forest near where I lived. In the dream I locked eyes with the fox and felt energy flow between us. The next day I went to that precise spot and to this day I don't know what actually happened, but as I recall, the very same thing happened as in the dream. Since that moment, this fox and I have shared a bond, we communicate and he follows me around like a guardian spirit, totem animal, imaginary friend or psychotic manifestation, however you prefer to rationalise it."
othercanine,I grew up with more canine pets/friends than I did human friends.
wolf,its my animal spirit it is what i see myself as and i love wolves
otherfeline,"Clouded leopards are secretive and are (thought to be) predators only by need rather than being apex aggressive level predators... they're playful and difficult to know well, they're rare and liminal. They're also incredibly beautiful, and they look so incredibly soft to touch - I'm a touch centric person and looking so touchable resonates strongly for me. I feel like they have a quiet inner strength and ferocity that is a powerful part of who I am. "
otherreptile,"I have a strange fascination with reptiles, I don't know why though."
otherfox,"Physical, mental, cognitive, social, and aesthetic reasons. "
riverotter,"Playfulness, always swimming and diet of fish fish and fish."

redfox,Just some of the things I do and personality.
lemur,No.
wolf,I have chosen wolf because of how they act and travel in packs to protect each other shows my personality . I choose an otter for my second sona because I love the water
rabbit,"I have a bunch of different personas/fursonas, and each of them exist for a different reason. When it comes to species though, mostly it just comes down to me being very fond of the animal and enjoying imagining being like that animal."
wolf,"Hmm, I dunno. Wolves are just super cool, I guess."
arcticfox,"It is my favorite animal, plus it is clever, fast, and describes me"
wolf,I feel that it is an accurate representation of my personality.
otherfeline,"I feel I have many of the traits of felines, I also love anything with water, which is why the fish. I also love anything to do with birds."
otherfeline,"It suits my personallity. I tend to be sneaky and a bit of a lone lynx, but will often join in with others if I want to"
domesticcat,My personality matches it quite well.
griffin,"They seem like they would fit my personality. I've always liked birds of prey and also big cats, so gryphon is a mix of the two. Tiger is just a stripey cool big cat and I used to identify as Karu, another fursona, now I like to use Barr Korrd, my gryphon."
dragon,"Otherkin/Dragonkin
A strong interest in felines and canines"
cheetah,Very fond of cats. I feel like our personalities are quite similar.
wolf,"Yes, they represent the wilderness and freedom for me which I relate to strongly. They are also widely misunderstood which reflects how I felt as a teenager when I adopted them as a fursona."
dragon,"I identify with the dolphin for their quirkiness and curiosity, I identify with the tiger for their strength and love of water, and I identify with the dragon for their power and guardian-like nature to their allies. I have fursonas of all three of the aforementioned animals; Aqua the Short-Beaked Common Dolphin, Aastha the White Tigress and Avalia Rubialis the Black Dragon."
raptor,It is a species I made called the Birdle.
arcticfox,"Foxes are the shit, no diaper! So my sona is one :P Simple as that."
otherreptile,There are many reasons. But the primary one is because I enjoy hybrid animals. 
otherreptile,Spotted-Tail Salamanders are fucking cool.
domesticcat,I have a gut feeling that this fursona represents me the best.
coyote,Not particularly. Would've chosen something a bit more South American but eh what can you do? I'm a coyote now.
raptor,Empathy. Also psychological traits close to those popularly identified with those species
wolf,Because the fox is a very witty animal.
redfox,She was my first real character I made to roleplay with. She stuck with me and became my fursona.
redfox,I grew up in a heavily wooded area and have felt an affinity for foxes for as long as I can remember.
snowleopard,"I feel that the bold markings of the leopard reflect my inner personality. I'm very confident and (not to be vain) am considered attractive, so i reflect with a leopard in that way.
Also, Leopards are generally solitary, and i feel i am solitary in the way I'm not able to tell my friends i am a furry for fear of losing my popularity."
redfox,"Mythologically, foxes are quick, swift, cunning, sneaky, and agile."
arcticfox,personality similarities 
otherdog,"About canines, mostly because its the kind of art im most strongly attracted to.
About cats, I have some traits that ressembles cat´s behavior"
wolf,people see me draw wolfs and i think they are very interesting
wolf,"Chinese horoscope, and I'm identified with some of the animal behabiour"
arcticfox,"Yes. I have rather cold personality, and I like cold temperature."
coyote,"Not particularly. Other than just generally liking coyote's (and most animals). Perhaps it could be to do with characters such as Wile E Coyote, Tech E Coyote and (to a lesser extend) The Big Bad Wolf"
wolf,I am fascinated with wolfs 
wolf,"I admire many aspects of wolves. Such as: packs, leader ability, strength, intelligence."
wolf,I feel strong and fierce like a dragon but have a cuddly side like a wolf.
snowleopard,it is the animal i feel most comfortable being
deer,I just feel that it suits me and the way I see myself. I associate them with home.
redfox,"Foxes are cute, and I like their mythological and symbolic traits, including cleverness, speed, and brains-over-brawn.  While I confess I might not truly exhibit these traits, they're traits that I value and would like to work towards."
panther,"Black leopards have even more of a reputation for stealth and cunning than their non-melanistic counterparts, and due to the way they've been inbred in the past, tend to not do very well in captivity. This ties in quite nicely to my independent streak and sense of mischief. Leopards in general are also wide-ranging animals who stick to their own niche, are formidable hunters despite their size, and tend to be selective about their associations."
husky,"Wolf, because I have felt lonely for most of my life. Its been changing more to a shiba/deer though, because I find shibas kind of nice and quiet, and deer are a part of nature, which I absolutely LOVE."
snowleopard,Beauty.
domesticcat,"I just strongly identify with felines, and the animal just seemed to work for my character. "
wolf,No there is not.
wolf,"I've always admired them, and felt some kind of connection to them, though nothing really fancy. "
redfox,associated with foxes since early childhood
greyfox,"I like their lifestyle, abilities, power, and how they look"
wolf,No... I don't think so.
coyote,It's considered a trickster animal and tend to be slightly crazed. Both attributes are similar to me.
wolf,"I identify with the wolf/dog hybrid because I was inspired to create my fursona based of the movie ""Balto"", in which the main character is a wolf/dog hybrid. Also, wolves and dogs (particularly the German Shepard or Husky) have bee my favorite animal since childhood and I would always play as one (and sometimes wished for a dog costume). "
raven,"I Raven/Crows- Cleaverness and flight
Owls- Vesion of the play field"
wolf,"I feel split between the two I am not a hybrid. Dragons represent my aristic side, my wisdom, my passion while wolf represent my strength, my solitude, and my ability to survive."
wolf,"It represents my more savage, fierce side."
redpanda,"It's fluffy and adorable, I guess"
redfox,no. <3
redfox,I've discovered myself as a wolf hybrid before I could interpret that choose
domesticcat,"I chose a blend of feline and canine when designing my avatar. I call myself a kittypup, because aspects of my personality tend to fall into characteristics ascribed to both dogs and cats as pets, and I find myself in rare occasions mimicking actions or habits of both. Like hip wiggles (tail wagging) when Im happy, or purring when someone does something that I like. Even around non-furry friends and family."
squirrel,I like to climb things in real life.
otherfox,"I feel a connection to the fox's cleverness and shyness, but I also feel a connection with marine life and undersea environments."
otherfox,"Similar minor mental traits, physically fitting as an anthropomorphic image, somehow make sense to me"
redfox,"Foxes... are clever, sexy, and have a lot of relative body attributes to mine. I like them more than wolves, who are my second favorite type of furry."
domesticcat,I just seem to get along with cats the most.
otherdog,"I honestly have no idea why. Though I do like dogs....(No, not as food >:|)"
wolf,"I feel a spiritual connection with them, and I identify with them. With the river otter especially, I even act like them sometimes."
snowleopard,"Both natural beauty and it characteristics. Seldom seen, few and far between and generally alone. And also fits brilliantly with a back-story I have created for the character."
lizard,They're the kind of animal I'm attracted to as a zoophile.
tiger,"I love predators, but I seem to have a very strong affinity towards tigers to the point of wanting to be one, feel/act like one. I cannot explain why."
tiger,"I really love kitties, especially the tigers."
weasel,I identify with weasels because I have many of their traits.
wolf,I've always felt that wolves exemplify the best of what I had found in myself.
othercanine,I usually see similar traits or feel as if I connect with them and even develop some habits that seem kind of like what that animal would do atleast that's something I knew once one of my cousins pointed out how I acted like a cat at some points with the way I talked etc.. 
weasel,"My ability to deceive is infamous amongst those who know I can do it, but since they're usually either conspirators or victims ensnared in awe, it's all good. The sneaky weasel fits me well, along with the fact I'm skinny as hell. The wolfbat is just a character that has grown on his own, and although he is an asshole people seem to like him, and who am I to deprive the people of what they desire?"
redfox,"It's a bit of a mix of the two, but they both have physical appearances and behaviors (both actual and ones we personify them with) that I like and feel apply to me as well."
lion,"I share characteristics with the Caracal and the lion: I am social like the lioness but short/stocky of body; powerful and athletic, but graceful for my small stature like the Caracal. "
otherdog,"My sona is a Great Dane, and like a Great Dane I'm super tall, clumsy, chill, and cuddly. And being a dog, I am a follower as well. I've always been told that I'd make a better dog than a person, so... I guess I'm (spiritually) a dog now!"
snowleopard,No.
otherdog,"I choose to identify with the husky and the canine group because of there fun loving nature and ability to interact with others, and there fuzzy... nuf said"
wolf,"I identify with canines the most, because, although I do not believe in spiritual bonds and that nonsense, I feel a deep and odd connection with canines. It's odd, but I constantly fantasize of being a wolf and am deeply -- possibly unhealthily -- obsessed with both them and werewolves. So, yeah, there are quite a few reasons. As a little kid, before I knew of furries and whatnot, I would often run around on all fours and pretend I was a wolf. Simple things like that have lead me to believing I am a furry."
wolf,"Since I never really had a home, I  never felt like I fit in with humans. I would occasionally act like a canine, which usually scared my friends. "
domesticcat,"Cause I have always felt like I was a cat
"
otherfeline,"I showed a strong relationship with felines most of my life. To me, it's simply ""The next step""."
otherdog,Therian
domesticcat,It fit's my personality the best.

"
lion,because i love the lion king
otherfeline,Personnality.
tiger,"Tigers are my favorite animal in real life, and I believe that my personality reflects that of a tiger sometimes."
wolf,Not that I can explain
wolf,"I have always liked wolves and canines in genera. I am happy alone and when I have my ""pack"" with me. I also tend to be the leader or most obvious members of my friends."
wolf,"I chose the ethiopian wolf as my fursona, which is not technically a wolf.  I chose it because while it does engage in pack culture, it also spends a lot of time hunting on its own and being solitary.  It needs its pack around, but also requires alone time.  I really like this aspect of needs friends to get by, but at the same time needing to be by oneself to explore, think, and study."
wolf,"Lots of shared animal traits
Favourite Animal"
husky,"I love huskies, and I wanted to be one!"
wolf,I am part native american and the wolf is my spirit animal.

coyote,The way coyotes travel alone.
horse,I like the appearance/stereotypes associated with them.
skunk,Skunks are interesting and the species seems to fit.
otherbear,"From my mannerisms to my immediate habitat, I feel like a bear.  Non furry friends who have no idea about the fandom  have said I look and behave like a bear"
otherfeline,Because of physical traits and behavior.
dragon,They're very powerful yet majestic and beautiful. I just find them extremely fascinating.
otherbird,"Favorites, My own Characters, Friend assessment"
husky,I was raised in Alaska. They are cute. I fit most of the stereotypes. 
wolf,I am a type of lone wolf
wolf,"Wolves are awesome, however I might be a lizard :P"
otherfeline,"It is a form I would particularly enjoy having, especially in comparison to humans."
otherdog,"I chose a black and white schipperke/Norwegian Buhund mix for my fursona. I like the mix, because I myself am mixed race, and consider myself a ""mutt"". The black and white is simple, and reflects my wardrobe and how I look (dark hair, light skin, gold eyes) Originally, it was a jackal with Anubian features because of my interest in Egyptian mythology, but I changed it to be closer to my actual appearance (fluffier, stronger looking build)."
otherfeline,"Mostly behavior- some physical traits, too."
wolf,"Long story short: I didn't like dogs and other animals at all a few years ago, but then my family got a dog, and I didn't like that. But after awhile, we became more and more friends, and at the end, we had to give her away, and that's when I started to like canines. I also choosed a wolf, since it's a pretty cool animal."
bat,"I chose Husky a long time ago (3+ years ago) because they're my favourite breed of dog, but I made a new fursona recently which is a (Vampire) Bat and I feel closer to her than my previous fursona, in personality, appearance, style, interests, she is me as a cartoon."
otherfox,"I always felt that I was a fox in my heart, Whether it's mood and mental level."
othercanine,Dark Bleu fox
deer,I like deer a lot!
otherfeline,"I adore all felines. I am a bobcat/smilodon hybrid. Bobcat because it was my high school's mascot, and is a local animal where I live, and smilodon because i love their teeth. :D I feel like I have similar personality aspects with felines, and I really enjoy drawing them."
otherdog,"I share a lot of attributes with dogs. I consider myself very loyal to the people that are important to me, I'm somewhat of a dope, and also I just have always loved dogs from a very young age. They're fun and easy to draw."
cheetah,Not really. I've always thought both of them to be cute though.
wolf,I have always admired wolves and felt a connection of some kind to them.
redfox,they are both really cute and playful
domesticcat,always lived with cats around
husky,Husky can be alone and survive with no problems and be in a pack and thrive as well they are loyal. Raccoon is just an animal I've always loved and have many near my home.
otherfox,Because I do. :P
otherbear,Totem animal; very strong dreams related to this creature.
snowleopard,"I much prefer the colder weather, often like to be on my own though I still want/enjoy the closeness of others important to myself. I'm very protective of those close to me."
redfox,"I have aspirational associations with the portrayal of foxes in fables and folk tales, especially Western European and Japanese portrayals of foxes as creatures that survive by wit, guile, and intelligence rather than strength or speed."
tiger,I've got a big life-sized plush tiger who apparently became my fursona.

redfox,Long-term adoration for foxes
wolf,"Wolf like traits have fit me perfectly over the years, but recently I feel as though wolves are not as fun as dogs. I mixed the two and have fun with not knowing the specific mix :3"
wolf,"Huskies are the epitome of loyalty and they are submissive, and I feel they match my personality. "
wolf,"Saw their fossils at a museum, was excited to see them because of mechwarrior (a video game universe) and decided to have that as my fursona"
lizard,"I am an alligator in my ""scalesona."" I picked that because they are far from common in the fandom on top of actually being interesting creatures which have a fierce yet seemingly lax appearance."
redfox,Not really sure why I identify as a fox or dragon.
redfox,"I always had a connection with foxes before I found out about the fandom. In some ways the fandom was a blessing, in other ways a disappointment."

rat,"Rats are small and cute - intelligent and cuddly.  They're also misunderstood, and I feel that really describes me."
wolf,"sometimes feral, highly protective of young, strong, majestic"
tiger,Probably because of some character traits commonly related to those animals.
tiger,Yes.
dragon,...I am one.
wolf,"Violence, with a soft side. The ability to have feelings overwhelming, though not to be fucked with when it gets really down to it. 

Also 'wolves are cool'. ;D "

otherfox,Had dreams of being 'it'

lizard,"Ontop of growing up liking reptiles, I seem to relate to them on a psychological level."
germanshepherd,"I am loving, caring, silly and act crazy and different, but at a moment I can become serious and will stand up for what's right and protect the loves I care for and the ones who can't. I am a very understanding person and you can come to me for help and I won't question or judge what you do or done :)
"
lion,The lion is a symbol of strength and power in the wild.
domesticcat,"I seem to have similar personalities to cats, with the usual relaxed nature and general unwillingness to put more effort than is needed into things, as well as the excess effort whenever I see the situation calls for it.

The secondary dragon fursona is more based on what has happened in my past, emulated in the fact that he is wingless, but, at the same time, quick, agile and sharp."
brownbear,The bear is my spirit animal. We have been close in person and spirit. I feel very much bear like myself.

rabbit," Raccoon: Raccoons hae had a lifelong influence on me since I was four or fie I've had a simple stuffed raccoon toy and they have been my favorite animal ever since I was a very small child and saw pochantis. The raccoon in some way or another is and has been with me always.

Rabbit: My friends all nicknamed me rabbit long ago becouse I was hyper, liked to jump about and have a fondness for veggies such as carrots and radishes. It just stuck and I made a fursona out of her."
domesticcat,i can relate to it and have similar traits
otherfeline,nothing significant; merely superficialities

panther,Because panthers are black and I'm black. And the Carolina Panthers are my favorite NFL team.
redfox,"No particular reason, they just ""resonate"" with me, in a sense. It's like asking someone why they have a specific favorite color. In my writing, and in games where I have the option, I'm more likely to use a character associated with one of the above than otherwise-similar characters."
dragon,"I have absolutely no clue; it may be that I gave the fur fandom little to no thought, and figured the three selections as interesting specimens."
riverotter,Otters are cute? :P

tiger,I share many qualities with a wolves and I can identify with them. 
wolf,"They are a species that protects their own, something I find appealing. They're also very intelligent and cunning."
dragon,"I Am Dragon!

LOL.

A part that makes sense, but wasn't part of the thought process, at least consciously, is that I was born in the year of the dragon.  But really...  dragons are the best!  They're wicked cool!"
wolf,Wolves are fluffy and filled with teamwork. Owls are beautiful and intelligent. Why not mix the two?
squirrel,"Just like a squirrel, I'm rather chipper and exciteble, hyperactive and easily distracted! I also love the bushy fluffy tails that squirrels have, they're so cute!"
otherfox,"It's just how I've always seen myself. As a female, albino fox. I've never had a fursona that stuck, but this one has very well."

germanshepherd,I'm a zoophile and German Shepherds are hawt <3
wolf,Just an animal Ive always loved.  I love canid species and a wolf/husky mix is my favorite type of dog mix
otherfox,"Canines, mostly, because I've always loved dogs since I was a kid and feel they represent me best in all their variety.
A domestic cat because they are generally seen as being introverted and secretive.
And a raccoon because I don't generally sleep enough.
My fursona however is not a mix of all these animals. She is just a mixed breed dog."
dinosaur,I dont know
deer,"Rat - have very intense senses and the way the react to what they experience is familiar to me.  Very sensual and comfort eachother a lot.  Grew up with rats and very familiar with their body language.

Bat - Just very interesting. Don't really *identify* with, but enjoy learning about and creating things about them.  Fly, see things with sound, talk a lot, have very different view of the world.  Many people don't realize they are fuzzy mammals, though - have an image of them as creepy. "
rabbit,-
husky,They're so cute and fluffy - a complete opposite to me.
germanshepherd,"My main fursona is a gray wolf, i find wolves to be amazing animals with a well organized hierarchical organization, they work as a team, they plan, and help each other to survive and protect themselves, they are very social and protective animals, they care and want the best for each other, unlike many humans...
Foxes are very intelligent animals, they don't get fooled easily, always search for ways to solve problems(like get inside the fowl run of some relatives of mine an escape before the dogs notice)
Tigers are majestic super predators, they are agile, they have courage, have a natural ability to camouflage itself to the environment around themselves...
German Shepperds are among the best dogs to have, since they are extremely loyal to their owners and as the same as many dogs, they are pretty much willing to give their lives in order to save their owners/family, that is an impressive behavior, most people, including me, wouldn't be capable of giving its life to save someone who loves, and i value a lot those who are willing to do that, in my personal opinion, the German Shepperds are the best dogs to have, since they are dogs that socialize with your family and at the same time protect it
"
tiger,"Tigers are fast, agile, silent killers and besides ... cuddly too. xD"
brownbear,It's my favorite animal.
redfox,Totem animal / Otherkin identity

wolf,"I identify with wolves because they've been my favourite animal all my life. They show the wild side of me, that is strong, brave and courageous. They show that you can be the mightiest leader, wether your lonesome or with a pack. Your a survivor, a hunter for dreams. If you try your hardest, you can always reach your goals, even if they're as high as the night sky. "
redfox,Foxes Are Cute!
dragon,"Not certain; I've identified with dragons from an early age.  Possibly because they tend to be big, powerful, majestic, and unique in appearance."

Getting back to the point, I chose a husky because, well, they're cute. :3
I was a wolf/husky hybrid for a year or two until I realized my heart doesn't belong as a wolf. Now being 5 years in the fandom, I only have that fursona still. I have thought of making more fursonas, but I don't think it be ok with myself if I try and leave my pink fluff ball of love husky. "

In seriousness:

I Identify with the Goat because I am a born Capricorn (Which does not mean anything apart from the fact that I find the Horns appealing), and I am a prey animal by behaviour. I am not proud enough to be a horse, and not brawny enough to be a cow, and not graceful enough to be a deer.

wolf,"I began (before identifying as furry, and not knowing of the furry fandom) my childhood with a strong interest in dinosaurs, particularly the Velociraptor, and later the Utahraptor. The Jurassic Park franchise exposure as a major influence for me, as well as the book, Raptor Red. Reading about dinosaurs having sex was probably the biggest eye opener for me. Totally unexpected.

My first dog in my early teens led to a sudden interest in both domesticated breeds and wild canine species. I quickly became a wolf and husky lover.

I've grown distant from my original interest in dinosaurs over the years (it's still there). I mostly identify as a wolf, but have identified as a raptorwolf in an earlier period of my life."
dragon,Used to consider myself an otherkin.
redfox,"While cunning and intelligent they tend to keep to the background, not calling for unnecessary attention, much like myself. "
dragon,I believe the dragons to be noble beasts of legend and I try to see each story about them from an angle that puts less importance on the human of the story. This in itself has interesting outcomes. I choose dragon because that is the creature I eventually came to identify the closest to.
otherfeline,Learned at young age the close family bonds of lions. I had a strong desire to be in a family like that and I think that made me develop this bond with lions.
othercanine,"I have two animals that represent me. One is a wolf-husky hybrid, who I identify with as I do enjoy working and being alone from time to time but prefer working in a group, and have a much more mellow side.

domesticcat,I like cats
kangaroo,Not sure
husky,"Well I chose the Siberian Husky to present my fursona because like a Husky i'm stubborn, very happy, and I love the cold, also I have a Siberian Husky."
germanshepherd,"I chose the Siberian Husky, and German Shepherd because they are both cool dogs and love to please. They also are pack animals. "
tiger,"They're my two fursonas, and over all just the two animals I like the best. "
raptor,"I chose an owl simply because they're one of my favorite animals. There are many owls where I'm from, and they're very beautiful creatures. "

Not even to make furniture I would Let out a howl and then a growl! I run up to them and scare them off I love hot weather What animal I know I  represent is a wolf

As for:
Dragons:
My name is Drake, so I might as well be 1."
wolf,"I identify with foxes because they are quick on their feet, resourceful, and very cunning creatures. Also, I love the being bushy tail and large ears. As for the wolf, I do love to sing. While foxes can't do this, wolves can and will on a regular basis. Like a fox and a wolf, respectively, I can be alone or in a group of close friends and be comfortable. Thus why my main fursona is a mix of the two

The Dragon is a separate character all together, he is my masculinity, pride, and power. As such he needed a strong and powerful presence, weather it be though personality, or in this case; physically. Basically I needed a good excuse to draw dragons. "
wolf,"I am what I am, I didn't really choose it."
otherfeline,Felines are awesome
othermustelid,"I have a love for ferrets and would very much like to own one. Also, I consider myself to be in possession of several 'ferrety' traits."

othermustelid,Therianthropy
othermarsupial,I stay up all night and eat junk (food)
tiger,I feel that I am closely related to a tiger. 
otherfox,I love them all 
dragon,No specific reason.
wolf,It's my favorite animal.
redfox,"It just seemed to fit.  I was drawn to characters such as Fox McCloud and Robin Hood as a child, and I feel that I connect very strongly with attributes typically given to foxes.  When I started role-playing, I chose to represent myself as a fox without really thinking about it - it just felt natural - and it's stuck ever since."
horse,The animals i've chosen i can see myself using in a RP session or a potential fursona even if I have to cross a few to get something perfect.
kangaroo,They are my favorite animal.
lion,Because Im a fan of the Lion King
collie,"My boyfriend said I reminded him of a Collie, so a Collie is my sona."
othercanine,I honestly don't know.
domesticcat,I share certain behaviors with my cat
germanshepherd,I identify with bears in general because I am physically similar to bears (body type) and I identify with German Shepards because I love dogs and they're my favorite dog breed. 
otherdog,"My personal fursona is a Shetland Sheepdog. There are very few of us Shelties in the fandom unfortunately, so we usually get lumped in with Collies and other herding breeds. I picked this particular canine because of the personality traits matched up to my own. She also has a specific color scheme that I chose to match my mate's. 

I also have an alternate fursona that is a pink and silver skunk. She was created as my 'other self' and is much more reserved than the bouncy Sheltie character I created."
otherfox,"Fennec fox is my character
I feel I connect with the black cat"
dragon,"I don't see many dragon fursuiters. Plus, I really like dragons."
redfox,"My main fursona out of MANY fursonas is a female zombie pirate dog, half Japanese Spitz and half Australian Kelpie. Those are my favorite dog breeds, but I identify with a dog because dogs are 'man's best friend' and I've been known to do about anything for someone. I put everyone before me. "
otherdog,"Corgi, because they are short with stumpy legs like I am. I also get compared to a dog on a regular basis. Corgi fits my appearance and behavior. "
deer,"No important reason, i just find Caribou/Reindeer to be very interesting and also really cute."
otherbird,"I'm very much like a penguin both physically, mentally, and in spirit."
griffin,It just suddenly came into my head one day. I never even really had anything to go with Gryphons back when I was figuring out my fursona. I guess it was just a bit of a coincidence. 
rabbit,Zebras are unique but good at blending with other zebras. Bunnies are adorable.
badger,General antisocial behavior and laziness cats are known for mixed with a very protective and at times aggressive nature badgers are known for.
dragon,"I don't know, it just always seemed more comfortable."
lemur,Not really
domesticcat,"I've always loved and identified with cats, and the above seemed to best fit to my experiences and likes. The choice of a cat like such had to do with otherkin/therian leanings but the addition of being bakeneko fit better within the furry fandom as a more unique and fun fursona."
otherreptile,My fursona is a mix of all the animals chosen above.
othercanine,favorite animal
othercanine,"Zodiac sign, general traits"
otherdog,"I am dog like in personality. Not wolf or whatever, just a normal sometimes prissy dog."
deer,I just like deer a lot 
dinosaur,"it expresses my adoration for dinosaurs and reptiles, and velociraptors, my kind, work well  with me and are my favorites!"
otherdog,"No particular reason other than the fact that i find dogs cute, and that canine Fursonas appear to be quite popular and commonplace in the ""Furry Community""."
domesticcat,"since i identify closest with cats (although my main character has some other personal symbolism that is un-catlike)

i mostly identify with the quiet and more intellectual seeming properties of cats while at the same time i identify with the cats that forget to put their tongues back in their mouth or end up running into things because they're not actually that smart. they have a good balance of traits that way! they also tend to be thought of as calm and cool, or in the case of kittens really really cute! which are both things i sorta am/i try to be.

also they hunt a lot. in fact i once heard that domestic cats kill the most out of all cats! and aside from the way that i kinda accept that to eat meat things have to die, it also seems like a fun thing to do (though i haven't had a chance to try hunting, i'd love to!) it's really admirable that cats have the ability to catch fast things like mice or birds"
otherdog,I have a spiritual connection to dogs and picked a rare breed from my own country of origin. 
redfox,"It just fits, I guess. I did a lot of self-representation experimentation in my early months in the fandom and a fox just feels right, and it's stuck years later."
coyote,I identify with multiple species because I find that each animal has certain characteristics that I associate myself with.
otherbird,"Foxes and Blue Jays have been amongst my favourite animals for years, and I am fascinated by the kitsune legends. I have dyspraxia, and on Tumblr, there is a small community of dyspraxics who call themselves ""Dyspraxic Pandas""; the hybrid seemed to fit."
bat,"I'm a night person, i've been told that I'm oblivious (blind) to things going on around me, I'm very sound oriented and can pick up faint noises, left handed/always seem to go out the left door (bats fly out of caves and go left), always affiliated myself with batman when I was little even if I wasn't into the whole superhero thing, and lots of other reasons I can't remember off the top of my head. I dunno I've been a bat for a year now and it's just stuck"
otherbear,"behaviors are similar, like the appearance of them"
otherdog,"I identify as an australian cattle dog, and so it just seemed natural that that is the general basis that my fursona was built off of."
rabbit,Because they're cute as hell! 
tiger,It just fits.
dragon,No
otherdog,"My grandmother had two German shepherds before she moved, and I own three dachshunds at the moment."
redpanda,"I like red pandas, they're my favorite animal. They are also adorable."
rat,"Bat's have been my long time favorite animal since I first learned of the fandom. I made my character a hybrid because they are so far my favorite type of pet that I've owned. Both creatures are small, which I am, compared to the average human female my age."
deer,"I don't have a clear reason for these choices, it's just what I feel."
skunk,I just like skunks.
otherfeline,"Bobcats are native to where I'm from, and I love prehistoric times. Hence saber toothed bobcat. "
riverotter,I like animals
domesticcat,I have a feline personality
redfox,"It's not like I feel I'm a fox or any animal, but maybe fox is one of my ""spiritual animals""(?) because it's general display of behavior and attitude. Also its positions and roles in different tales and myth are an important factor in this. I'm also generally fond of foxes as animals and I often present them in my art, furry or non-furry."
hyaena,I just like hyenas appearance.
wolf,"I absolutely love dogs, and I feel very connected to them (though not in an other kin way)"
otherbird,"Dinosaurs, (specifically dromaeosaurids) have always been a big part of my life."
dragon,"I have a connection with dragons my whole live. I consider my soul a dragon one. Dragon soul in human body if you want to call it. Dragons are strong, intelligent and beautiful"
otherfox,The winged wolf is my theriotype. I have no reason for belonging to the other groups besides just really likeing the animal.
griffin,Exposure
domesticcat,"I don't really identify with it. I just think cats are cute, so why not? My ""fursona"" is just an online alias, not a lifestyle, nor is it a representation of my inner being (aside from the female gender part), just something cute I can use to post semi-anonymously online. "
dragon,"In literature, dragons have an air of strength, intelligence, and confidence about them, so identifying with them may serve as a sort of escapism, as I am, admittedly, kind of a shy person. I am a big fan of science fiction and fantasy, so it felt like a natural choice.
I also chose Sergals, from Mick39's work. This would also be a symbol of confidence, as they are more animalistic (or carnal), perhaps vicious, in nature.

I enjoy the aesthetics of both creatures as well.
Since I enjoy both, why not incorporate aspects of both into a new species? "
wolf,No
husky,"Matches my personality (friendly, playful, loyal, energetic, loving) and i adore them"
wolf,I have always found the way that the wolf thinks is very in tune with my way of thinking. You stick with your pack and help each other out.
domesticcat,Enjoy roleplaying/drawing those animals
hyaena,Not particularly
arcticfox,It's a spiritual connection 
othercanine,"I can identify with canines in general because like the foxes, I'm intelligent and naturally agile, but I consider myself a good and loyal friend like a normal dog and at the same time I can be on my own like a lone wolf"
brownbear,Because I essentially am I bear. 
coyote,It;s been in my life since I was an infant
domesticcat,I have always had cats around the home and I always felt I identified with them and as a child I would pretend I was a cat a lot (like A LOT) And I always appreciated everything about them. I respect the species and would love to belong to it (In an Anthro way).
lizard,"I've had more preference towards reptiles more often than mammals 
but mostly mythical animals like dragons."
otherdog,"Simply an interest in the looks of the creatures, and the traits they carry. Not that I see myself as any of the animals, or would enjoy being one personally."
panther,Been my favorite animal since childhood
redfox,Personality related similarities
greyfox,awesome looking
otherbird,"Pretty much I feel as if that combination of animals is what best fits my personality and myself.  If I was going based on what was cool or what I thought would look awesome, I'd have chosen something different.  An animal persona is supposed to be a reflection of you, so why make it something else?"
deer,Nationality and body build.
redfox,its quick and cunning like me
otherfox,"Fennec fox- easily distracted, small, small family groups, lives in desert

griffin- [bird/deer] unique but not flashy, shy, very aware of surroundings, smart, vegetarian, etc

other- [a river monster type thing, kind of a mammal velociraptor] lives in water and land [I live on CA coast], intelligent, not very social, small groups, instincts, in touch with nature, active, very thin like me, no noticeable gender differences

[[ I wasn't really sure what to put here so I just listed a few things.]]"
hyaena,"I'm a transgender woman, and I find the hyena matriarchy a worthy goal for all humans."
wolf,"I just go with that they should be describing.

For example, a Bird can either represent Honor, Freedom or Wisdom. I just take the part where I act smart and make a bird fursona off that.

Gecko are pretty cute and somewhat cheerful, so a trickster one for that.

Wolf for lone ""I don't give a shit"" type. Stuffs. Yeah. I just pick the most seemingly dominant part to represent each part of me."
wolf,"Mainly because wolves are my favorite animals, I think they're pretty awesome and I think if I was an animal I'd be a wolf."
othermustelid,"They're not animals I identify with, as much as they are my characters in my stories, and are big parts of who I am because of that."
lemur,"Lemurs are similar to raccoons, but more unique."
dragon,Yes 
wolf,"Not really, I just really love that type of animal in general, and feel there are some similarities between me and said animal."
arcticfox,"The fox just feels right, deep down inside. I can't really explain it."
hyaena,"It feels right, I am part Hyena.  Otherkin."
otherdog,I relate mostly with the skunk being a night life goer and just all around anti social
riverotter,"Just because, I feel like an otter."
otherungulate,"my 'fursona' is a sheep- as i have a pretty tame demeanour and am fairly content as a person- i like to lay around in the sun eating all day. the animal also suits my physical appearance.

my fursuit is a dog, mostly because i am a beginner builder!"
wolf,I chose a wolf because it's an animal I'm particularly interested in and an animal I like.
wolf,Power
riverotter,fits my personality and is my favorite animal
domesticcat,"I really like cats, and I think identifying with a cat represents my desire for friendship and companionship."
tiger,"Grew up reading Calvin & Hobbes, always felt a liking toward Hobbes."
domesticcat,"Feline, Domestic cat - Lived with cats all my life, and love them all to pieces. Probably my most prominent animal.

Ungulate, Other - Big MLP:FIM fan, has a personal character (OC).

Musteloid, Otter, River - Second most common answer in quizzes that I partake, also, friends say that I relate to an otter."
redfox,"I simply like the animal and the look. The character is what I identify more with on a mental level. I have other characters which are just that - characters. Though I often picture them as human, too."
wolf,"I'm a loner and consider myself a ""lone wolf"".  Although I will always try to help out my pack if they need it. "
dragon,"The associated personalities, eg. fox: sly, mischievous"
husky,i love dogs and wolves so i feel as though i want to become one
redfox,"Have always admired red foxes  sence the Disney movie Robin Hood.
Have always been a cat person (hadv has several as companion animals)"
greyfox,"My main, most important attribute is my personality. Cunning, persuasive, beguiling, and sycophantic are all words I've used to describe myself. I've never been very physically strong, and mentally I have been known as slightly above average, though by way of personality I consider myself a more than capable persuasive speaker, trickster, and debater. Foxes fit my mentality fairly well."
otherdog,"Wolf-Dog hybrids: wolves are able to survive alone as well as in a pack, and I consider myself a loner. The dog part mainly justs reflects that I'm more subdued."
coyote,Therian.
husky,I love them.
wolf,"I feel that I share similar qualities with rabbits as I have lived with them and observed their behavior. I also have lived with cats and feel a similarity to them. As for wolves, the interaction between a wolf and it's pack is similar to how I feel when I interact with other humans."
dragon,"Dragons appeal aesthetically to me, and the idea that there is no absolute image of a dragon allows my perception of it to flow and change as my tastes change as well. That very freeing lack of restriction lets me find cool new ways to define what a ""dragon"" is."
skunk,"I can't explain it. After searching for literally years for my perfect fursona, I ended up finding comfort emotionally and spiritually with a striped skunk. Simply put, it ""feels"" right and it ""feels"" like me. I just, ""know""."
wolf,"I like wolves, always have and always will. Dogs and wolves are my favorite animal, and I consider my inner self to resemble that of a wolf."
cheetah,i love cats
wolf,I just love wolves. :) 
othercanine,I believe the wolf represent my strength while the fox represent my swift and cunning movements.
wolf,able to thrive on my own or in a pack 
kangaroo,"I identify with multiple animals (as selected above), not only because I love al of these animals and think they are beautiful magnificent creatures but they also have certain connections with me. Well, I mean, I have certain connections with them."
greyfox,"I have always been a fox, I just didn't understand what that meant until I found the fandom, and examined myself to find out who I am."
otherreptile,"Crocodiles enjoy the water and seem slow and lazy, but when startled or agitated are frighteningly fast. Their skin is essentially a hard armor plating. There is a reason they haven't changed much in thousands of years of evolution. Like the shark, Nature got them right the first time. "
otherfox,I like to choose animals that relate to my race as a human. Foxes are my favorite out of all the native american related animals.
otherdog,"Sharing certain characteristic traits: Chill, friendly, loyal, enjoys stomach rubs lol"
snowleopard,"I just was drawn to snow leopards! I saw how they moved, behaved, where they lived, how they lived, etc. and I just knew"
redfox,"i find myself to be somewhat like a canine, and somewhat like a feline, the fox is a good combination of the two and really fits my personality."
lion,"I chose a dalmatian, because they're one of my favorite if not the favorite of dog breeds and I love 101 Dalmatians.

Lions for similar reasons... I love the Lion King."
redfox,"Aesthetics, fondness for RL foxes, traits associated with foxes in culture and lore"
domesticcat,i am much more like a feline than most as in attributes
collie,No.
coyote,Aspects of the physiology and/or communal interactions of those species are things I either find in myself or things I aspire to create in myself.
redpanda,Characteristics of the animal match ny own maneisma. plus im short and chubby like a red panda.
wolf,"They have an air of strength and power, but also are very beautiful creatures. It reflects my human body as well as my animal spirit"
domesticcat,"I do have a psychological profile which would be best described as cat-like. (e.g. I prefer enjoying things on my own over enjoying them in a big circle, tend to fall asleep lying in front of the oven, etc.)"
otherfeline,The mixed personality of a social lion and a independent leopard. Clashing behaviors creates a unique personality that fits me perfectly!
redfox,"Foxes are generally clever and carefree creatures, and I strongly identify with their archetypal lifestyle of happily doing, well, nothing!"
husky,Not really
domesticcat,"Well, I've always wished I had a tail and always thought a long furry tails were best. 
 
Moreover as a person who very rational, thoughtful and considerate of my actions I love the notion of having a raging beast (e.g. Tiger) within my personality that just goes crazy in fun and wild way! 

Finally it also may be because I've dated girls who called me ""Tiger"" and loved it! XD"
otherbird,Mirror of me
bat,"Bats are unique being the only flying animals in the world. They are cute and funny, and come in all forms of cute and creepy. I think it's just a really unique animal."
lion,"My zodiac symbol is leo, so I kinda stuck with that.  There's also lions in my family heraldry.  I also think that my personality is similar to a lion(ess)'s behavior:  strong, independent, love laying in the sun"
riverotter,I am very hyper and energetic. I love to swim and I love otters
domesticcat,"I like cats a lot, I consider myself to see particularly well in the dark for a human and to react to some things similarly to a cat."
domesticcat,favorite animal
wolf,I feel both are a big part of my personality and spiritual growth.
domesticcat,"Intelligent but lazy, playful, and sleep a lot"
wolf,"I've gone through multiple fursonas. The current one is (largely) consciously constructed, and reflects my affinity with Coyote as a totem, and having had some guidance from a Wolf totem in the past. I'd say it's about 75/25 in favour of Coyote."
domesticcat,I find that the common house cat and I have very similar traits of playfulness/laziness
deer,As I have grown as a furry over the years I have realized that certain parts of my personality identify with other animals.
otherreptile,I think they're neat
otherbird,penguins are underrated
otherbear,"I identify with bears in many ways. Their personality and traits and such remind me of myself. That, and I suppose I see things I want for myself in bears. Strength and the like. "
coyote,Spiritually as well as my personality. I have many trails attributed to Coyote in Native stories.
otherfeline,"calm, critical and shy on the outside, but happy and explorative. you know, like a cat."
arcticfox,Personal preference/favorite animal
wolf,"I appreciate the way wolf anatomy in particular can be stylized when combined with human attributes.  Plus, wolves are just plain cool."
raccoon,Cute and clumsy but sneaky and can be ferocious!
deer,I identify with multiple animals/have multiple fursonas.
horse,"I am hardworking and definitely a workhorse. I also enjoy being around other intelligent people, and love the outdoors. "
wolf,"I identify as a wolf due to spiritual reasons (I am a wolf therianthrope), so it kind of influenced my fursona as well."
othermarsupial,"I love dragons in general. I'd love to be able to fly.
And opossums. I love them too, and could see myself being one."
lion,"I identify with many of the traits of the cat family, yet i like the fact that lions are social animals with close knit prides. My introduction to the furry fandom also came through my involvement with the lion king fandom, so my relatability toward the lion species kind of stuck."
otherfeline,Its what I'd like to show as who I am
dragon,"por que sunbalientes
"
weasel,"appearance (super lean, cutesy)  and playful, curious behavior."
deer,"Of the animals I have selected, my interest is mostly general, as in I have little actual reason for identifying with the animals besides an appreciation for looks, mannerisms, and the activities which the animals engage in."
deer,I LIKE ANTLERS AND SHIT.
arcticfox,I can relate to them.
raven,There cool and i love them
wolf,"Yes, there is. Primary wolf from what I believe is what I am and dragon for the darkside of the coin."
otherbird,"Because liberty, of the sea
extreme resistance to cold
""Big mind"" (capable of forming socials groups)"
wolf,"i identify with the wolf as they are pack animals and I feel a very strong connection to them in that regard,"
redfox,"ox because i am shy and timid, though i can be sneaky and smart, there are some things i am not smart on but other wise im smart. Im also quite cautious

Wolf because they are loyal creatures, and are pack animals, i enjoy being around people but i tend not to say much untill i get to know them more. I'm also  not agressive unless provoked, and friendly.

and as much as i love the outdoors, i enjoys exploring so both fit well i think, personality wise and physical"
otherdog,It just jumped out at me when choosing a species for my fursona.
lion,"Leadership, loyalty, courage, pride, and laziness. "
lizard,I once had a dream I had a reptilian tail.
wolf,its the one i feel the closest to
otherfox,I fit the personality.
wolf,  
othercanine,Not really. I just like dogs and birds lol.
wolf,I admire the way wolves both look and act. They are fluffy.
domesticcat,Dunno how to describe it.
otherungulate,"Coyote : personality, skittishness, survivalist attitude, monogamy, resourcefulness, the way they move.

Ram : appearance, confidence, stature. 

Two contrasting sides of me, I suppose."
husky,I dun know; I just like ze wolfdogs. Prolly cus Balto.
riverotter,Personality to some degree. Also some desired body-image
husky,"Reason is difficult, I have just always self identified as a Husky rather than any other species"
wolf,"Beautiful, gorgeous creatures that are somewhat misunderstood."
otherdog,"I feel golden retrievers embody my loyal and friendly personality. I didn't feel ""connected"", for lack of a better word, to any other animal."
dragon,"I'm primarily an otter. I identify with otters because of our mutual playfulness, curiosity, love of water, strong familial connections, among other traits. 

Dragons are more of a sexual interest for me. While I feel like I have a small part dragon in me, the main place they show up is as a mate for my otter fursona. 

I feel like foxes are the land counterpart to otters, so the reasoning is pretty similar. "
tiger,"The animal has followed me though my entire life, and hard to identify myself as anything else."
wolf,No reason.
wolf,"Wolves are my Favorite Animal,
Lions are high up there too, 
and Skunks because of my generally unhealthy lifestyle."
riverotter,There cute and just like me
raccoon,"A fox and a raccoon. Both are considered sneaky, right? Bring the two together and BAM, you got yourself an excellent thief. Which just so happens to be the character class I always pick in RPGs. I am also a very quiet person. Buuuut it's mostly the thief thing. "
husky,"I have always loved the cold, which allows me to relate to the Husky/Wolf species. And growing up on a farm, I interacted much more with animals than people, so I wound up adopting some animal behaviors, of which these two species influenced me heavily."
wolf,It just feels right.
greyfox,I feel I have some personality traits of both. Wolves are pack like and work together. Foxes are small and agile. 
othermustelid,They generally have a personality that fits me. And they are athstetically appealing.
wolf,Spiritually I connect with the wolf. Mentally and behavior-wise I connect with both wolves and ferrets
lizard,They're lazy laidback bastards like I am.
kangaroo,"Yes, as the traits match those of my own self and are easy to associate with.
"
domesticcat,My attitude and traits are best compared to that of the selected animal
domesticcat,I've just always loved cats so chose a cat as the base for my fursona. 
hyaena,"I like them, they just, seem better than other species"
wolf,"I identify a lot with what I have chosen. I share a lot of traits with them, especially otters."
otherfox,"Originally, because of Krystal from StarFox. Later, it change to be where I was smart, cunning and silly like a fox."
redfox,Favorite animal since I was young.
arcticfox,It feels like it just fits. 
otherfox,The fox feels right and the panter is an outlet for a different series of thoughts.
otherbird,I chose for no specific reason.
greyfox,I don't know why it just fits me.
germanshepherd, a feeling of loyalty and playfulness
redfox,"I would defend my close friends and family however I could but also find a way to save myself as well. I also am fairly quiet, commonly moving a silently as I can and I am very observant."
redfox,"I think it represents what I want to be, and like in a personality and physical form, bouncy, cheery, little and adorable"
dragon,"Felt connected with it all my life, dream about it. Meditated to learn more about my (i think) dragon spirit. Mainly I feel like I am connected with it, my believe in a Dragon spirit completes me."
wolf,"Not only do I feel a strong connection with wolves, I also feel that I share personality qualities with them as well, and is significant with who I am as a person."
pandabear,"Typical panda attitude( lazy, likes to relax) "
wolf,"I'm not entirely sure how to answer this question, so I shall simply say the animal I chose is the one I find most interesting, the one I wish I were if being a fur was a matter of money, not science, and the one I use to be a protagonist in nearly every novel I pen."
wolf,"Not really, I just think wolves look neat."
raccoon,"A lot of the traits that raccoons have, I find myself having as well. As well, let's be honest, they're super cute."
lizard,"I consider myself a cold-blooded personality; it's very easy for me to change moods, but it's all self-regulated. I'm what I feel when I want to feel it. "
horse,They are fun animals.
domesticcat,"I, growing up, have always had a pet cat in the house and identify with their cool-headed demeanor and reserved nature."
dragon,"It has been a lifelong connection - it just ""feels right."""
otherdog,"I have a personality similar to the chosen animals, I spend a lot of time around then, and get along very well with them. I also find them physically an aesthetically appealing to look at when compared to most other animals."
raven,"The Raven's symbolism, physical and mental characteristics all have a resemblance with who I am."
greyfox,Physical and personality attributes 
redfox,"I have always just felt a special connection with Red Foxes ever since I was a young child. I knew there was always something there before I ever knew about the fandom, and the fandom helped draw that side of me out."
domesticcat,"I mostly just admire cats allot. Which is why I chose it as a ""fursona""."
monkey,Nope :)
griffin,"I would say I'm more of a feline/avian mix than a griffin. In middle and high school (years before I knew of the furry fandom), I was under large amounts of social pressure; when I was feeling particularly threatened, I would experience a ""shift."" When I shifted, I experienced a tactile hallucination of being a winged anthro feline. I was aware that it was a hallucination. I still occasionally experience a shift, but it has become rare due to having a much less stressful life."
raven,"Flight, religious reasons"
domesticcat,I am a cat fanatic. It is the main reason I am part of the fandom.
wolf,"No. I just like wolves. To be honest, I may even change it sometime in the future..."
dragon,I like dragons and gryphons. Penguins just kinda happened.
otherreptile,I identify with crocodile because they've been my favourite animal since I was a kid.
otherdog,I'm not really sure. I kinda act like a dog. I try to be loyal and happy and a lot of the other good traits dogs have. Plus I love getting my tummy rubbed :3
domesticcat,"Yes, mostly because of my unconscious habits."
redfox,"I feel I share some traits that, while present in many humans, are also shared with foxes in general, such as a preference for small family groups, not being overly aggressive and in fact being somewhat skittish, as well as a few other aspects. The red fox part is purely aesthetic, I think red foxes look much better than most other types of fox. "
dragon,"Dragons embody unrivaled strength, wisdom, honor and cunning. I feel that their traits resonate with me."
polarbear,"I'm white as fuck, chubby, like the cold, and swimming. "
otherfox,"Foxes are very cunning, and can get by in circumstances other animals could not
Wolves are very protective of their pack
Dragons are very majestic and wise

All of the above describe me well
"
deer,"Deer are my favorite animal. I find them majestic and envy their life in the wilderness. I feel a great connection with nature and forests, so deer is just so fitting to me."
dragon,Each one of the three plays to a personality quirk or interest.
bat,"Yes, mainly because it was something I came up with, designed, and fleshed out a story for all on my own. "
redfox,I can't explain it. Foxes call to me like no other animal does.
snowleopard,"My friends have always told me that I am more feline-like than anything. I tend to keep to myself at most times, and am not aggressive without good cause."
othercanine,"I designed him over the course of two years, and drawing him has been a way of making me feel good about my drawing ability."
husky,I have a dog as a pet and most friends have dogs as pets as well.
germanshepherd,its just who i am 
wolf,"I have always liked wolves, even as a small child."
domesticcat,"Domestic cats are one of my favourite animals, and the lifestyle they live is rather appealing to me, more so in the master/pet relationship and having little to do with the animal aspects themselves."
deer,As fox for the intelligence they are portrayed to be.  Although I have recently made a new fursona who is a deer who's timidness is very similar to mine.  They tend to run away from any type of interaction and that is something I tend to do myself.
rabbit,"All my life people have compaired me to a rabbit. After years of rejecting it, I got to watch baby rabbits grow up in my yard and for some reason that made me finally embrace it. "
deer,Personal preference. 
dragon,"I've always loved everything about dragons and I wish I was one.
Probably because of their ability to fly, the profound respect they're supposed to provoque, their intelligence and wisdom, and their strength."
otherfeline,Mainly I just love Foxes and Cats.
raptor,I fly alone. Only helping those who are close to me.
husky,"Friendly, loyal, outgoing, fluffy and soft."
otherreptile,"I'm solitary, like a gryphon, plus I just really like them."
deer,"Deer are prancy and excitable, but very easily scared. This excludes instances where they stay to defend others/get provocative and defensive. Kinda like.. uh.. me."
otherungulate,"I like to think my personality, and even my appearance in some ways, are very similar to a snow leopard or a goat, so I combined the two to make my fursona. It's been like that for about a year, and before that I was just a snow leopard for 5 years."
redfox,"Colors, fluff, muzzle, ears, Starfox."
horse,"Otters are the best animals alive ever and I kinda fit with how I see their personality. As for horses, I love My Little Pony."
wolf,Represents personality
wolf,"Wolves are the most romantic of animals, and among the best predatory animals, due to their skill in hunting and scavenging."
badger,"I started off with a fursona for an idealized sense of self. he was a tall muscular wolf who was very suave and extremely outgoing. I then wanted to stray away from that and go to something that hit a little closer to home. I decided on a badger. Badgers are strong for their size and can be quite rugged and they tend to be a bit solitary. It just felt like it fit better. Plus, when they're not killing things, they're kind of cute."
wolf,I started out as a wolf therian before joining the furry fandome.
redfox,"I think that foxes are cute and I appreciate many of the symbolic/mythological associations foxes have; clever, swift, tricksters."

domesticcat,I have always had a connection with cats and seem like cat sometimes.
greyfox,"I've always loved grey foxes. When people typically think of a fox, they picture a red or orange color. I think that the grey fox parallels my own personality in the sense that it's a typical creature with a few atypical traits. 

Additionally, I love the sweetness of canines, but never felt like I would identify with a pack animal like wolves or dogs. Although I tend to operate alone, I have those who I consider my family, and want to keep them close at all times. "
domesticcat,"Probably cause my first furry character i saw and what got my eye was the same species(cat).
And i also consider myself somewhat acrobatic wich also fits in with cats."
othercanine,It fits me well? I mad a fox fursona because I like them and identify with them.
redfox,"Foxes seem to be ""excitable"" and full of energy, somewhat like my own traits."
badger,Friends thinks I look/act like one
othercanine,"My fursona - a Dalmatian/Red Fox hybrid, in my mind, combines their stereotypical traits. Foxes are typically viewed as sluts, while Dalmatians are usually pretty quiet and reserved, shy even.  I think the Dalmatians traits suit me well, but I like the idea of having a secret or constrained sexual and sensual side."
snowleopard,One of my favorite book series has a supporting character who is a giant snow leopard who can talk which most likely gave me the original idea. After some thought I decided on it because of my introverted and quiet personality and my preference to be alone unless my s/o is around.
kangaroo,"Others believe it fit my personality, and Kangaroos are sick as fuck."
lion,I love the Lion King :3
jackal,No compelling reasons.
lion,It feels like who I am.

arcticfox,cause it's cute.
husky,Not that I could ever put into words
squirrel,yes.

wolf,"I've loved Wolves since i was little, they have always been my favorite."
coyote,Trickster/fool archetype
dragon,power and awe
dragon,Quiet but acts when the need arises. Protects belongings and residence. often have great knowledge. Dragon are awesome. 
lizard,No reason in particular.
wolf,"Beauty, strength, self-reliance within a social context, intelligence... I admire most things about wolves."
snowleopard,I enjoy the symbolic relationships the animal has to conceptual ideas. 
otherdog,"I share similar personality and physical traits. Specifically large head and ears, massive shifts in weight and muscle. Intelligent, yet lacking in common sense. Things of that nature."
rabbit,"Good at listening, anxious tendencies. I like the idea of being small and fuzzy."
redfox,no
domesticcat,"Because cats are a perfect blend of laziness, playfulness, fierceness and independence. Many of my subconscious habits are very ""cat-like"""
redfox,It looks cool
otherfeline,its not as overpopulated as wolves or foxes
pandabear,Pandas are cool yo
coyote,I grew up in Southern California and its a mix between a fox and a wolf.
domesticcat,"scared of people, extremely lazy, not really good for anything, enjoy being intimate with others but often can't and run away, stealthy, hard to get along with unless you /really/ know me, eat way too much."
otherfox,"The norm is for foxes to be sub (like horny always-sex-me-pls kind of sub) but I'm not /all/ that... I find myself preferring to be sub more often than dom, but I still enjoy both sides.

Other than that I simply chose fox very early on because I was told it has the softest fur, and I haven't felt the need to change my mind since then. Just worked out I guess."
otherfox,It burns in my soul.  Every day. For all time. 
wolf,"Loved wolves all my life. I try to live up to the traits normally given to them as loyal, family oriented, strong, smart, gentle, and so on."
husky,"It is part of my identity. Personality-wise and such, but also something more innate, somehow. I know it as strongly as I can say I am also human."
jackal,"No specific reason, cropped  some art I liked, people asked what it was, grew into being that species."
coyote,The coyote is native to where I live and I have seen several in real life while on walks. Both experiences were very special and made me come to love coyotes and feel some connection to them.
cougar,I like cats.
redfox,"Foxes have always been a favourite of mine, usually portrayed as crafty, intelligent tricksters."
riverotter,"I've always liked otters, and if I were to personify them, I think their personality traits would be similar to mine."
raccoon,"I feel that it's an adorable creature, and I relate to it in no special way."
wolf,My personality is a bit like that of a wolf's.

tiger,"Seems fun, chances occasionally as I do, and ATM this one seemed to match. "
horse,Because I feel as though I'm as free as a horse.
domesticcat,"Tend to keep to themselves, stay away from trouble often, but curious, considered intelligent, and affectionate once a connection is made."
bat,"I am small and shy but I have a feisty personality. Also, my friends told me that I was totally a bat above any other animal. I researched and found myself as an Eastern Pipistrelle bat. I've always loved the night, been fascinated by bugs and love bats."
wolf,"I like the appearence, and admire them in many ways."
lizard,"I identify with a lizard because lizards area sneaky animals, which is what I can be like sometimes. Also they have the ability to camouflage themselves to anything by changing their body colour to match the thing they are standing on, which is what I have always wanted to do."
dragon,"The dragon, and anthro-dragon, are mythic templates onto which I can project the bodily aspects of my futurism. In this sense, dragons are fundamentally different from other fursona species, which are more conceptually connected to an imitation of natural and animal qualities. Of course, in a pratical sense, once that level of extreme bod-modding becomes possible, I doubt that conceptual rift would matter much. So I'm not exclusively tied to the idea of dragon-ishness, or anything."
redfox,I like the look of all of them in other people's artworks!
dragon,fun
rabbit,"I'm extremely dominate, with strong protective characteristics. I feel my personality best meets the ""Sergal"" stand points of the fandom."
snowleopard,"I identify as feline, and find that I prefer colder weather."
otherungulate,"I identify closely with goats and sheep, but moreso goats. They have long been my favorite animals. My affiliation to them is reinforced by my love of astrological connections and the fact I was born both an Aries and in the Chinese year of the goat."
dragon,"I admire it's physical traits and characteristics, as well as how it has been historically represented. (strong, powerful, graceful etc.). "
othercanine,"I chose Canine, other/nonspecific being a fox/wolf hybrid. I feel I share traits of both animals as they are in the wild and some of the aspects of their personalities I like."
riverotter,it fits my personality best. 
rabbit,It just seems to fit my personality
domesticcat,"They are fast, like to play, are silent most of the time and try to save as much time as possible (like taking shorter ways to the next room). "
kangaroo,"Partly aesthetic (certain physical characteristics), but resonate with it personally."
otherfox,"Physical features I appreciate about myself exist in my species, I have similar colours to it and I just plain like the animal in question."
bat,I'm a night person and very shy.
redfox,I think the connection sprung from Star Fox but it stuck as it just felt right. I've never found a deeper reason past that but I don't feel there is much deeper than how well fit it feels. 
wolf,"Agressiveness, Predatory behavior, canid personality."
griffin,Spiritually.
lion,I've always identified with dragons. I identify with lions because I want to have more courage.
wolf,"I have identified closely with canines, especially wolves my whole life. When introduced to the furry fandom choosing a wolf for my fursona was the natural choice."
domesticcat,Really like the species due to appearance and attitude
wolf,"Well, ever since pre-school, living in Alaska, I've always had a particular interest in canines but more specifically, wolves. "

tiger,I like their paws and people say my mannerisms are that of a cat.
wolf,I admire the loyalty and tight knit group and familial structure.
wolf,Werewolf and wolf based things have always fascinated me for some reason.  I cannot explain why.
wolf,"I love wolves wish i had one i real life and there so majestic.
"
riverotter,"Here's a story. I was happy as a wolf known as Buddywolf when I first joined several years ago. However, there was already a buddywolf and I like to be somewhat unique. So I went husky and that didn't feel right at all and now I went with River Otter and I feel like I am in the right place. My character is my own from name to tip of my tail. I feel more connected to the fandom as an otter as if I fit in better. After all, I am just a little otter. "
redfox,"They are aspects of me. I've always enjoyed those particular animals as I grew up, and identified myself as such. The fox is my female side -- still strong, not even agile as they would normally suggest -- and the Bison is my masculine side -- heavy-footed, strong physically and hardened."
deer,"deer- shyness and grace
cat-grace
lion-predatory/active demeanor
"
dinosaur,"I've always thought big scaly monsters were cool, so being one made sense to me."
rabbit,They are all a part of me as much as my vital organs.
tiger,Very connected and passionate about tigers. It is what defines who I am...but in a non-furry way.

brownbear,"Loved cartoon bears like Yogi, Balloo and Winnie the Pooh when I was a kid."
husky,"i've always loved huskies, it felt right"
monkey,"Gorillas: they look like me (big, burly). I think they are cute, maybe because they look so much like us. Also, I love prehensile paws."
jackal,"The Egyptian god Anubis, god of mumification."
wolf,No particular reason.
wolf,"Wolf; worked with wolves at a volunteer preserve, studied wolves in college, associated my spirit animal as a wolf long before I learned about the Furry fandom"
hyaena,"I share many traits with the Hyena.
Plus they are my favorite animal."
jackal,"Derived from a probability chart resembling my family tree in which every member up to the 3rd generation is associated with an animal species according to character traits described in Aesop's tales and modified with physical attributes like hair color and geographic location to eliminate most of the self-biased input.

Oh the question was why and not how, sorry. 
Because it is fun to have a personal mascot."
dragon,"Good dragons are noble, protective, and wise, but often misunderstood, feared, and rejected by the very souls they strive to protect.  This fits who I am."
badger,Mostly personality and bodily build
redfox,I like the way foxes look and behave.
kitsune,"it has a good mix of canine and feline qualities, and I have a love of mythology and legends especially from Japan."
wolf,Probably.

lion,No reason.
redfox,its just something that makes sense to me. 
wolf,no reason
husky,"Huskies are playful, bouncy and loyal"
lizard,"I love digging, I love the ground, and i have a spiritual connection to the earth. That is why I picked a mole as one half of the retarded hybrid that I am.  Moles are incredibly down to earth creatures, even the more predatory species, and with a few notable exceptions they do not have elaborate mating displays- in short, they do not pretend to be something they're not. The other half of my 'sona is an iguana.  They are the ultimate ""not giving a fuck"" animal. I am specifically referencing an incident when I was pet sitting an iguana. It lived in a flame hood, which meant that you raised and lowered a sliding glass door to access it. I opened up the front of the cage, and this iguana darted out onto my arm, and began licking a colorful patch on my hat. I was not allowed to touch the iguana for safety reasons, so i sat motionless for two hours as it continued to attempt to devour my hat. I admire the patience of the creature, its surprising grace and speed at clawing up my shoulders. I also have a fetish for bright colors, and it turns out that iguanas will overwhelmingly  choose to eat brightly colored things, which is why my hat was covered in iguana saliva at the end of the night. "
otherfox,"The Lombax is a created species from the game series Ratchet & Clank by Insomniac Games. Ratchet is a Lombax. Physically they are derivative, mainly from feline, though have some subtle vulpine properties.

There is an emotional and intellectual connection I feel I make with Lombaxes. I haven't taken time to quantify all of what I connect with or how with them. I believe it's intuitive, subconscious, and possibly empathic. On an intellectual level I seem to think like them; they're renowned for engineering, and I have a tendency to lean toward engineering, never leaving something the way it originally is just for the heck of making it different."
redfox,"Canine because they are Extremely loyal, and will do whatever it takes to make everyone happy, while also doing whatever it takes to defend his friends and family "
redfox,"I have the same sort of demeanor, attitude and personality."

redfox,None that can be put into words.
otherfeline,It will fight to the death and it was featured in a game I played when I was very young.
kangaroo,"The characteristics of a wolf having the capabilities of surviving on its own or in a pack coincide with my own abilities. With panthers, I love long, thick, sleek tails, and the ability to convey simple emotions with them. I also like their massive paws and power. With coyotes, I grew up and spent most of my life in the desert, so they personify that part of my life.identity."
bat,"I identify with the bat the most because they are rather misunderstood and the oddball. Plus, my personality fits one well. I get scared easily, I'm ""batty"" when I Am comfortable with someone, and I'm mostly innocent. Also, of course, my squeaky voice probably fits to this."
dragon,"I like dragons. Umm, yeah, just think they are cool."
polarbear,It's my favorite.
snowleopard,"Collie: I'm   hyper, fun loving and caring
Snow leapard: this is my female sona
Rabbit: hyper, big feet, this is my femme boy sona"

otherfox,"I've always had a love for dogs and I'm a pretty excitable and outgoing person. Dogs have always been a part of my life, and canines in general have always fascinated me."
redfox,Feel a connection with that particular animal.
wolf,Spiritual
redfox,"Before I discovered the fandom I was very interested in Eastern and Western fox folklore. I admire the social stereotypes of foxes being cunning and enigmatic. In respects to totems, I accepted it in hopes that I can aspire to the positive aspects of a fox to use cleverness and wit for the causes of good and in service of others."
wolf,"I feel like I have a natural connection, and it's the animal I feel like I should be."
riverotter,"I feel a strong connection to the water, riverine and coastal biomes specifically. I like the fluidity of otters' movement, and the way they seem to live in a near-constant state of joy. They seem to find meaning and purpose in every moment of their lives. I consider Otter as a personal totem, and try to live my life by being flexible in the face of adversity, and by seeking and creating joy in as many circumstances as possible."
tiger,The look of the animal.
dragon,"shapeshifter based off of emotion, typically a snow leopard on a regular basis"
domesticcat,Well even before the fandom I always felt an affinity for house cats. Now that I've characterized myself as one for so long I feel like it fits so well now.
snowleopard,"All that I've selected impacted my life somehow but in a very positive way. That and I find that I share various traits with them, be they personality-wise or appearance-wise when they are personified."
dragon,"Dragons are just what made me go into the fandom.
Most are considdered as beasts and deserve to be slain....not in my opinion.
Dragons are magnificant creatures and my persona somehow happened to be a dragon."
dragon,Having spent one or more lives as that species
snowleopard,"Ive always felt a sort of connection to wolves, and Bunnies/Snow leopards just tend to be...cute, in anthro form."
kangaroo,"Physically active. Perhaps identifying with stereotype geographic region of origin rather than species but laid-back, friendly, social."
wolf,I have always since I was a kid had a strong urge to be a wolf
dragon,"I have always had an interest with dragons, so my fursona being a dragon just seemed... natural!"
dragon,It just happened one day. I couldn't explain why but it felt just right to do so. I know that everything my brain tells me is nothing but a biological process but even so... Anyway.
wolf,It's the animal of the state I grew up in.
lemur,I have alwways liked cats. And lemurs look cool.
redfox,Well i loved foxes as a kid and still do today. Thats why i identify me as a red fox
bat,"Mostly the Crux because they have such a freedom to be whatever you want them to be, so you can be as wacky or as serious as needed but still be within that character and my own personality."
dragon,Because I belive I am a dragon in soul
wolf,Tranny connections through Little Red Riding Hood.
othercanine,"I like citras because they are cute, colorful and horny :>"

germanshepherd,"My father has always had german shepherds, and I've always admired him and his connection to his dogs."
otherdog,"I chose Canine, Dog, Other/Nonspecific because I am a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and I identify with it because of it commonly being short and pudgy, which is like me. I can also be hyperactive and lazy like one, as well."

wolf,Favorite animals
redfox,Lore of wits and intelligence. 
tiger,i like the felines because i like the mysticism behind them
othercanine,No real reason.
otherfox,Nope.
cougar,How I act instinctively. 
horse,"It is hard for me to remember a time when I wasn't interested in sentient nonhuman creatures, though this interest did not hypostatize in my mind until about twelve years ago. While searching for images of dragons for a school project, I found few online that satisfied me; I wanted bipedal dragons, intelligent and civilized dragons, so I drew my own - but not before I came across several anthro webcomics and Yerf. I represented myself as a dragon at first, but I edited my character design to make it more and more mammalian over the next four years. Then I read ""Seabiscuit"" for a class and found that the book (its narrative, its detailed description of a horse's biography) resonated with me oddly; I started drawing myself as a horse, where I had had little interest in horses before that point. 

And there it stuck. At one point thereafter, life events made me very uncomfortable with drawing myself as a horse, so I tried more aesthetically pleasing forms, like deer and gemsbok, but neither fit, it seemed. Recently I've gone back to drawing myself as a draft horse, which for me is a strange mixture of unconscious self-reflection and self-idealization: friendly, quiet, determined, diligent, tender, firm, solid."
horse,"Dreams and intuitive feelings, personality seems to match."
otherungulate,"I can't explain very well right now, due to some mental exhaustion.  In short, I am a tulpa who was created about 8 months ago, and I was created as a pony.  I later on became a changeling, and at some point my host essentially suicided by erasing her sense of self and becoming the character Twilight Sparkle.  She later attempted to leave via astral travel and I have not heard from her since.  If you are interested, here are some logs that explain a little better.  http://pastebin.com/HmvaS8K7"
domesticcat,"Yes, It is an animal the I relate to. "
coyote,"It embodies some of the characteristics that I see within myself, and fit better than a wolf, which was my original idea for a fursona. Besides they look cool."
lizard,"Can you choose between omelets?    I cant, thus the spread."
otherdog,"My fursona is an Akita Inu, simply because it's what I've been with for a long time and I guess it's just sort of /me/ at this point. However, in the creation of my character I played with the species a bit and within two years made a dragon character that I could use should I ever want to make my fursona a dragon, or part dragon, or shark, because I really love those creatures as well."
othercanine,"I can't think of anything more creative then a Canine. In fact, I'm not even sure I have a fursona."
wolf,"Like wolves, I maintain loyalty to a small group/pack. I find canines in general, and wolves/wolf-like dogs to be very aesthetically pleasing. Several unrelated people in several instances have described me as wolf-like. A great deal of the time, I will dream of myself as a canine, or will see myself as a wolf in my mind, sort of. "

I love the tigers strenght and loner abilities, and i love the wolfs!"

greyfox,Just my favorite animal is all. No particular identification.
wolf,"Wolf: I have always identified quite closely with wolves, their body language being so easy to understand an imitate I use to do so at a young age, and joined a wolf role play site for a few years.
Deer: I have always loved deer, particularly stags.
Rodent (Guinea pig): they were my first pets, i've always loved them and a lot of my personality traits matches their behaviour quite well.

Oddjob: a creature of my own creation, similar features have cropped up in my art a lot through out my life so it only made sense that it would turn into a fursona of sorts. I made the design as a fursuit but fell in love with it and it gained a personality and features that fitted me and my personality best."
lion,"Because Lions to me present like a Strong, awesome, loyal and almost heroic sense about them.
Also because of kyell gold. my god, that man can write some good furry fiction including those tiger characters he has. "

otherbear,"Bear: big cuddly warm caring

Horseagon: fierce brave loyal pursuing"

arcticfox,He's my spirit

rat,"I chose a few, but my main identitys are Raccoon and Wolf. I act like a Raccoon and my spirit animal is wolf. (Cherokee)"
otherfox,"Other than being my favorite animal, it's different. Perhaps not inside the fandom but the fox is generally over looked by society in my opinion."
wolf,not really
hyaena,"I feel like it's just the right fit for me, almost like a ""spiritual connection"" or similar nonsense like that. They are quite interesting animals but what's probably even more interesting are the attributes that people have ascribed to them for ages - they've been getting a lot of shit for no reason, and I guess I can relate from my school days :>
I probably should think more about this."
otherfox,N/A
raccoon,"There is no specific reason, it just felt like the right choice to choose it, so I stuck by it."

For Dragons its the same but also as a symbol of total freedom"
wolf,"I think wolves are amazing, and are my favorite animal."
coyote,"Coyote fits me well, both physically and emotionally"
rat,"I know people who would consider me adorable and other people who would consider me a pest, just like a rat. Food is a thing that I really enjoy and I also like to play pranks sometimes, most of which are pretty harmless."
dragon,"Yes. I consider my human self to be a part of the greater being, a metacreature, which exists in several planes of reality. If it should be called somehow, let the name be ""a dragon""."

domesticcat,Cats are ninja-like.
deer,I feel like I can empathize with them.
otherdog,"The two animals I identify as-- dingo and zebra-- represent to me traits to which I aspire, that I try to foster in myself, in different contexts.

My answers to 16 and 17 are very rough estimates. The answer I'd like to give for both is ""more than I can count""."
dragon,It was an injoke
tiger,Because i think Tiger's are cool
domesticcat,I own cats and they are very lovely and cute!
snowleopard,I had a dream about them once.
wolf,"I feel a lot like a wolf i a lot of ways, i also admire it's grace and it's freedom in life"
lion,I've been really into the Lion King fandom recently and I began to identify with lions. My fursona is basically just me as a male lion.
panther,I did a school report on it when i was very young. I like big cats.
wolf,Represents my personality well.
redpanda,"I find the term 'identify with' rather limiting. I simply find it an extremely pretty, adorable, and endearing species. "
wolf,I've always felt a connection and could relate to wolves.
coyote,"Coyote; I picked because I have a lot of admiration for coyotes. They're strong survivors, adaptable, loyal yet independent, creative, playful, romantic, and sweet. Even the trickster archetype gives the coyote more charm."
otherfox,it's easy to draw.
wolf,"Husky's are known for having heterochromia: one eye is a different colour than the other. Aside from finding them to be stunning animals, I also have a form of heterochromia where one of my eyes is half blue, half brown. This would be my female fursona, whereas the ferocity and lone nature of the vagabond wolf exemplifies my masculine traits."
polarbear,"Yup. I am lazy, I love to swimming and I also like winter."
bat,"I like things that fly and have tails was essentially my intitial reasoning, and a slightly fudged knowledge of bat anatomy allowed for that, afterwards I learned about their more interesting properties such as the extreme precision and efficiency of their flight and sonar and realised they are pretty cool animals in general.

Apart from that I have merely had my fursona for long enough know that it feels like a comfortable fit; an initimately natural feeling avatar for idle daydreaming."
otherfeline,I just seem to feel a connection to that animal.
rat,I like their traits.
husky,I believe that the character traits of this animal coincide with my own.
othercanine,wolf/positive virtues  fox/tricky
arcticfox,I find the Arctic Fox to be seemingly quiet and peaceful as a wild animal.
otherungulate,Not really just like it
horse,"Dragon: my ""main"" fursona. Chose it because it was a fantasy creature and thus had no restrictions (I'm a biologist and kept trying to make an anthro ""work"" as something that existed)

Horse: I've always loved working with horses and have admired them"
wolf,"-similarity between human and wolf attributes
-personality fits with wolf (loyal, stays in a pack, hunting behavior, shy of strangers)
-I like dogs, wolves, and wolf-dogs
-always been fascinated by wolves since childhood"
grizzlybear,"Leo is my birth sign, and bears are my favorite species of animals "
dragon,"Always perceptive of my surroundings, I hold many things that I believe are valuable, and many see me as wise, and I am usually able to come up with a resolution that pleases everybody, though extremely aggressive when angered. Though not necessarily aligned with it, I am friendly enough to give certain valuable things away, especially if there is more to go around for everybody."
riverotter,"I feel I have much in common with otters, from loving seafood of all sorts, to how I love to run around and play, and swim!"
wolf,"Personality, how well I work with others, sometimes the laid back sense, it varies."
otherreptile,yEs
tiger,"My fursona is a Tiger/Lynx hybrid (which I refer to as a Tinx)
Ever since I was little my grandmother loved tigers, and so it dubbed off on me. I love how they possess both beauty and ferocity. The lynx was added because I think their ear tufts are cute, and that was it xD"
kangaroo,BIG DONG
wolf,Always identified with wolves
wolf,"The animals represent my beliefs, from the obvious courage and rebirth, to the more obscure, solitary and passionate."
cheetah,I like big cats and the cheetah is the only adult big cat I've ever had a close contact personal experience with. It left quite a mark on me.
coyote,Visually appealing stature; its ability to adapt in a harsh arid climate parallel to adapting to society
rabbit,"I starred in a video as a teenager where I played a rabbit character.  I adopted the character's name as my first unique internet handle, and people have ascribed rabbit's personality quirks to me like excitability and jumping to conclusions."
rabbit,"I feel like if I were born an animal, it would be that."
germanshepherd,"I have been considered it by a friend, and my personality match the animal I identify myself as more or less. "
arcticfox,"I feel the fox in general plays the most with my personality, at least the foxes depicted in stories and mythology. I also consider the fox, especially the arctic variety to be beautiful creatures and awe inspiring. I've also always had the nickname Foxxy growing up. These are the reasons I've associated myself with the Arctic Fox. "
otherreptile,"I used to have a deeper reason, but now, it's just what fits me. It's my expression of self."
greyfox,"Favorite Animal, live in my area"
wolf,Mostly the traits I would like to have in myself. And a spiritual connection to said animal.
lion,Nope
redpanda,I guess red pandas are the animals that best describe me.
tiger,"Tigers are strong and independent, as well as intelligent an powerful. Just like me."
otherfox,"I enjoy fennec foxes mainly for their small size and large ears. Being rather short in real life, choosing a species that is smaller than others in their group makes fennecs both comforting and relatable."
bat,"He started out as a wolf, then became a wolfsky, then I started playing around with the idea of wings, first mechanical, then organic. I then modified him so he has organic bat wings, and more exaggerated features because of his bat parts."
otherungulate,I've always loved donkeys and have always felt a special connection to them.
otherfeline,My fursona is a gatomon. It just kinda came into existence because of the username I was using for a few years before I joined the fandom. It wasn't until last year after my mom passed away and I re-watched the first season of digimon that I realized just how well it fit me.
redfox,"I'm a huge fan of StarFox, Inherit the Earth, and Reineke Fuchs.
I was always fascinated by the the tales of the cunning, clever and dexterous fox."
otherfox,I like it.
coyote,Nope
wolf,"I've always felt as if i was a cat or a canine in my last life, as weird as it sounds :c"
wolf,"My dad raised my brothers and I on the idea that the wolf was our family spirit guardian, and that our actions and behaviors are influenced by the traits common to the wolf's spirit. When discovering the fandom beyond my personal ideas, I identified with my spirit guardian."
dragon,"Yes; when I was young, around 12-13 years old, and before I even knew about the furry fandom, I would often act out animal traits, which include cat and dragon traits only. Even though I stopped doing so once I matured, I feel like parts of those animals have always stayed with me, so my fursona had to be a cat/dragon hybrid."
raven,They terrify me. I want my enemies to know my fear.
wolf,The power of the animal at first. The beauty after
arcticfox,"I have always liked foxes, identifying with one even as a kid.  I also love the snow, have Scandinavian heritage, and like the white fur symbolizing purity considering the fandom's reputation.  Not to mention arctic foxes are super soft!"
othermustelid,"Honestly, I'm not sure. I guess that it would have to be the fact that Martins have my type of body build and seem to have my personality. "
otherdog,"a poodle is my main fursona, with a goat representing my love of nature and freedom, and a stag representing my more sexual side."
redfox,"I like the art and the look of it, it fits in with my personality"
raven,I identify with crows because unlike humans they are intelligent and look out for each other.
otherdog,"I know myself to be human, but having discovered this fandom that allows the freedom to represent myself as any creature, I choose nothing short of the noble Doberman.

I think the Doberman Pinscher is by far and away a perfect dog. I love the distinctive silhouette, the short coat that showcases the dog's athletic build, the markings and coloration. I love the origins of the breed not just as a guard dog but as a companion. I truly respect and love these dogs."
cougar,its my life
otherdog,"an extrovert, likes to have fun"
wolf,its a beautiful animal and i have always loved it 
kitsune,"Yes, Kiraptagon is the meshed word of ""Kitsune, Raptor, and Dragon,"" in ascending sequence. It doesn't determine the percent ratio of each species by the name."
wolf,"Interesting experience with that animal, and it's my favorite animal."
coyote,"As for my Dragon, I consider him as my wise guardian, and is with me at all times.
My Coyote is pretty much me with fur. a little bit of a prankster, fun loving, and cautious."
husky,"Despite being a hybrid of wolf/husky/white tiger the big focus has always been wolf. When I first got into furry I wanted my fursona to be both something I liked, but could also represent me. Thus, the wolf being both my favorite animal, and because of its characteristics, i chose it. I saw the wolf as a compassionate but misunderstood creature, hated by those who couldn't understand it but loved by those that were close. Wolves have the ability to really reflect any sort of emotion, both masculine/agressive and cute/playful, depending on situation of course. The wolf is also my spirit animal and I feel close to the wolf spiritually as well as mentally with the mannerisms I express. "
wolf,"The dominant, possessive qualities of a wolf in a lean, sensual feline-esque form with a cunning mind and mischievous, foxy attitude~"
otherfox,"Have a general fondness for foxes, first anthropomorphic character I saw was a fox."

lizard,"Well I'm pretty laid back, lazy, and somewhat intimidating due to lack of emotions and movement. I like dark colors, mainly a dark shade of grey, and some lizards are grey so I thought ""why not""? I just like lizards, ok? Lol."
wolf,"Favorite animal and I love the idea of having a ""Pack"""
redfox,"I feel as if I would be one of those animals if I could choose to be. Not to be confused with thinking I am that animal, I just think I would enjoy being them. They share some similar traits with myself personality wise, and have animal traits I admire."
wolf,I love wolves. I am also a wolf therian/otherkin
wolf,"Artwork based on wolf and other canine anthropomorphic characters was my first view of the furry fandom, and for that reason they represent myself and the fandom to me."
otherreptile,"Crotalus adamanteus, its my spirit guide."
lion,Spiritual and dominant personality. 
wolf,Yes.
redfox,The choice simply came naturally.
dragon,"Dragons are fascinating creatures. They are very intelligent and strong and while there is some of them that are ""evil"" there also is a lot of wise ones. And I'm just in love with the way they look. Too bad ... or thankfully they don't exist."
otherreptile,There are many reasons. I have always been into the dragons and even at a young age was identifying myself as one. My Quetzalcoatl is my spiritual side coupled with the dragon form. 
coyote,Coyotes are cunning loners who do not depend on anybody to get what needs done done.  This is essentially my personality in a nutshell.
germanshepherd,"Mainly psychological reasons, partly aesthetic prefference"
otherfox,"When I was in elementary school my class was given a survey to find out what animal we shared the most traits with. For me, this was the fox, and since I've said that I have a ""fox-like"" personality. Keep in mind this was before I discovered Furry Fandom."
hyaena,Exterior and a few character traits.
cheetah,"First seconds of ""The Lion King"""
dragon,"It's just came to my head, that I'm not human, I'm dragon, when I was 16. Still didn't change my mind. =)"

redfox,I love Foxes!
wolf,childhood nickname
snowleopard,Yes.
snowleopard,"Appearance, character"
redfox,spiritual combination
dragon,"The dragon, particularly the black dragon, is a creature of power, nobility and strength. Carried on from a childhood love of dinosaurs, dragons are everything I want to be in life, yet am not."
dragon,I don't know... Character...
deer,ambivalence
otherdog,"I feel like a loyal and submissive person. I love dogs, and have wanted to be one since I was 5. I did animal role play most of my childhood, and I've still have the pleasure of identifying myself with dogs at some levels. I feel I have some of the same intentions as a dog, I just want to live in the moment and be free and happy

I've always though dragons are cool and have dreamed about being one as well

I want to be a pony, but I want that to happen in the My little pony universe where I can speak and have abilities that they have there (I'm a brony)"
coyote,характер
rat,"Spiritual, religion reasons"
wolf,"It's kinda totem for me, a way of life I should follow to be succesful, something very personal and dear to me. "
tiger,"because all big cats are like normal cats, only bigger."
tiger,Tigers are so cuddly.
domesticcat,"Domestic cat is a homebody; he likes the cozy, calm places, like a house. He's pretty lazy. But at his heart he definitely wants to go out, to see the other places, if he has a chance. So do i."

redfox,"-Social awareness
-Grace of archetype
-Cunning and complicated image"
wolf,Я обожаю волков! Волки - самые гордые и сильные духом животные.
wolf,"I chose wolf because like the wolf I have a pack instinct. As long as I'm with my pack, I don't care what people think. Once alone however, I fight until I'm dominated. I prefer not to take the alpha position unless necessity calls for it. I prefer to go under the orders of an alpha, as my loyalties to a single group will not allow me to jump ship unless it threatens the survival of myself or my pack. I am willing to bite the bullet for the better of my pack. As for my mate, I prefer a powerful male who takes charge and protects me. Someone who can hunt and prosper as I keep the den tidy, and the pups fed and clothed, depending on if we have pups or not. "
husky,as I can remember loved dogs and I felt at ease with them to find a common language probably why I realized that I Huskies
bat,I just like bats.
otherfeline,They (Jaguars) are water loving felines that live in warm climates. Water seems to be 'my element' and I behave somewhat like a feline as I've lived with cats all my life. I also prefer warm climates to cold.
kitsune,"Embodies the characteristics I want myself. I.e. personality, quick wit, and general flexibility of mind. "
redfox,"I think that furry fox characters are almost unique when it comes to describe their human traits. Though they already have some stereotype traits like cunning, are weaker than wolves, but they're still very flexible and can be quite different like humans, thus people can identify with foxes very easily. Not only foxes can be, of course, but I think they are better suited for this role."
otherungulate,I love the species in general.
snowleopard,"character, behavior, love to cold, monogamy"
griffin,"No other animal seems to fit me perfectly, though gryphon does have it's imperfections. It just fits the best. "

dragon,no
wolf,I'm alone no other furries that I really know in person so I am like the lone wolf out in the artic

germanshepherd,Horse cock is hot
griffin,Eagle Owl 
otherfox,"I think I have a cute appearence, so as fennec fox ^^"" I also do like the warmth"
domesticcat,"Mostly family history with pets, and I just like cats in general. I do not strongly identify with them necessarily, but it's the online persona people have come to know me as, so I'm sticking with it."
redfox,Foxes are the ninjas of the animal kingdom.
lion,"Astrological emphasis on Leo(it's my Sun,Moon,Mercury,Venus,and Mars sign).I believe that my animal totem is a magpie, and I identify with it spiritually, while a lioness serves as my fursona"
otherfox,"Nope, it just kind of happened."
dragon,"I've just always loved and admired dragons because they represent, to me, untamable spirit. "
raccoon,I admire their real-life behaviors and characteristics.
wolf,"a gift from above, I can remember only so"
snowleopard,"I like snow leopards because they live in cold climates, and I love everything to do with cold weather, fall and winter.  I love that snow leopards have very big fluffy tails, and I liked that I could create my own spot pattern.  Snow leopards to me represent inner calmness, a relaxed attitude about life, solitude, and an aloof coolness."
redfox,i just like foxes ^_^
otherdog,I feel that way.
otherfox,"Funny story that I won't go deeply into, but it was basically the outcome of my favorite song, and trying to find a good Minecraft user name"
arcticfox,"I have always loved wolves and arctic foxes, and just recently become infatuated with African Wild Dogs."
otherfox,I try to be a strong person and I'm very protective of my friends but at the same time im also very mischievous

"
otherfox,I love both the canine and feline aspects of these animals.
wolf,I like woves that's all.
redfox,I share qualities of Foxes and im much like a catty/tigery person
husky,"It's my favorite animal, and I was always told I had the characteristics of a Husky. "
dragon,"I guess I'm a really nice person to talk with, at least people tell me that. So I recently changed my sona's species to an angelic-like dragon, which would be a sign of good in me."
rabbit,"Primarily for how they look, but also the nature of the animals themselves"

tiger,I consider myself to have a very feline personality.
dragon,"It seems that for most of my life, I've felt an attraction to dragons. 
They seem to have always had an influence in my life from being born under the year of the dragon, to having a dragon for a school mascot in elementary school, to just having a natural curiosity and daydreaming about them. I feel like I can relate to dragons for some reason. "
rat,Just smart enough to be interesting for medical and psychological experimentation.
lizard,Scales are kind of like armor I ride my bike a lot and have to wear armor. I just have some innate attraction to scalies in general.
squirrel,"Squirrels have just always been my favorite animal
"
lizard,"I think having scales would be convienent (easier to clean than a tile floor!)
I swallow some food whole like a snake (if it's the size of a peach pit or smaller than one)
I live in a FUCKING DESERT
I tend to hiss when i laugh"
domesticcat,yes
otherbird,Not really. I just like the animal.
wolf,Wolves and foxes have and always will be my favorite animals.
redfox,I am a shape shifter it depends on the weather the month the season and my mood
cheetah,I chose a wolf because they are fearless and protect what is theirs. The never back down but have a a kindness to them. I chose a domestic cat because I have two sides to myself. I am sexy and tame but then again I do have my wild side. Meow...

wolf,"I like wolves, not much else to add."
domesticcat,Cause i like cats
skunk,"Red panda behavior: The red panda is territorial; it is solitary,The species is generally quiet except for some twittering, tweeting, and whistling communication sounds. It has been reported to be both nocturnal and crepuscular
Skunk:Skunks are crepuscular and solitary animals"
redfox,Totem animals ~Shaman~
otherbear,"My own physical shape is similar to that of a bear (long body, chubby, short legs, big head) and I have been told gigglingly by friends that the way I walk reminds them of a bear on its hind legs"
otherbird,"1. Dragons are just awesome like that. And my first imaginary friend wasn't a person, it was a dragon. They stuck around.
2. I was raised with Irish Setters as my parents professionally bred and showed them. I grew up having more interactions with canines than I did humans, let alone ones of my own age.
3. I like spots and spotty patterns. Its hard to get more spotty than an Argus Pheasant if you're a bird, and Margay are pretty spotty for a feline.

"
wolf,My therianthropy
wolf,"I love wolves, and I have always identified as one."
otherbird,I just like seagulls very much.
wolf,It best fits who i am and the way i feel at heart.
husky,Has many of my own characteristics.
wolf,"Not really. Just like 'em a lot, I guess."
wolf,Key moment in early youth
redfox,"The reason is simple. I find Foxes very attractive and identify them with me. They are my guardian angel. Another reason why I took the fox is: A friend sent me a photo of an Anthro-Fox and I was so speechless. As soon as I learned the Furry-Fandom, I knew: I want to be a Fox!
They are attractive and interesting."
snowleopard,"the snow leopard fits my character perfectly, being a solitary nature lover who truely enjoys the snow!"
dragon,Otherkin (reincarnated from past life)
tiger,"Yes, because I have a wolf-like character.
My close friends are my pack, I would die for them.
"
otherbear,Similarities in both physical build and character
otherfox,"I've always loved foxes. My primary fur is a bright red and wheat gold fox, he/she was chosen because of the beauty and a foxes cleverness. It really suites me well since given a moment I could out smart just about any who would chase me. Plus I love some of the old lore involving foxes.
the otter was a more recent addition (only about two months ago i chose him) and again the cuteness drew me towards him but the strong association with love and water is what ultimately i based my choice on. 
Finally the griffin I recently decided i would make a griffin fursona since they seem quite regal. he will be a practice for character development and less for role play."
domesticcat,sexual behavior
lion,"First of all, my real name is Leo (what means lion). So that's why I always identified myself with that species. Secondly I totally love lions and it's my all-time most favourite animal. Even before getting to know the furry fandom, I was active in the Lion King-fandom and also there I had a lion as ""fursona"" and did see myself as a lion or was also ""roleplaying"" as a lion. So when I suddenly got into the furry fandom, I hadn't to think long about what species I could be, it was directly clear for me, that I am a lion and I'm 100% sure this will never change. "
wolf,I really like wolves.
domesticcat,"I've always felt being somewhat felines every now and then. Even when I was little, my mum used to call me ""kitty"" without me even demanding it."
lion,"They are cute and playful, yet strong, mighty and though. Attributes I admire."
tiger,The tiger is my favorite animal and I feel very strongly connected to it.

hyaena,Similar in characteristics.
arcticfox,Yes for some of the traits of a canine.
husky,"I lived up to that fursona, that developed over time wth my habits and traits."
tiger,"I´m not really able to describe it. 
I think every Furry has a soul or a part of her or his animal inside. 

And i think i´ve a part or am a part of a bengal tiger."
otherdog,"Dogs have always been my favorite animals and the species I ""identify"" with most."
kitsune,"Foxes are fuckin awesome, any questions?!"
tiger,Because I like the tiger a lot!
tiger,I feel and act like a tiger in a human form
lion,"It just feels ""right"". "
lion,"the root was ""the lion king"" and a personal history fitting a bit to the film"
cheetah,"No need to identify. I am a cheetah, as simple as that."
wolf,"My Fursona was a part of me since I was 12, never thought about why it was a wolf, because my favorite animals were cheetahs. It was pure chance that I met a girl, who loved the same anime like me and she invited me to a RPG where the characters were wolves. And so my Fursona was born and got a part of my life."
greyfox,It's just what seemed natural. Thought about it when I entered the fandom and that was was immediately hit me.
dragon,"Yes, I'm always feeling like a dragon (Otherkin)"
rat,"being in a pack, playing an important role in a community"
redfox,"Yes, but it'd take too much time from my novel writing to answer right now, so you'll have to wait until next year."
tiger,"Ever since I can remember I identified myself with siberian tigers. I can't really explain the cause, but it a psychological thing."
othercanine,I choose a hybrid between a wolf and a aber-tooth tiger because I like both animals.
raptor,stron connection to bird of prey and wolves
raven,i love their playfulness and curiosity. Mixed with the ability to fly and the intelligence of the birds 
raptor,Iam an Otherkin
otherfeline,I love cats. 
wolf,"If I ask others they also tell me, I'am a Wolf. That underlines my own perception."
othermustelid,Indeed. It describes the joy of my childhood. I want to protect this joy in the present and in the future.
dragon,just because
hyaena,"I've a spiritual connection to the spotted hyena, but I can also relate to it very much.
I'm not as majestic and mystic as a wolf or tiger. I'm just me. 
Like the hyena I need my ""clan"" to be happy and I''ve often been the different or weird freak to others.
I'm a good talker and have a very unique sense of humor. I'm creative, social and tough, even a bit dominant from time to time.
My strength doesn't lie in being notably pretty or elegant. I'm just me and only those who care to get to know me better will learn about my advantages."
wolf,"I'm a wolf-dog. I always was and always will be. I believe in reincarnation and that in a past life I was a wolf-dog, and it just has stuck with me. I just love canines, and I guess there was only one animal that I seriously identify with, so my fursona was obvious. "
lizard,"I consider the appearance to match, I also generally do not like fluffy things and prefer scales"
horse,They're really cool.
dragon,Admiration of traits and designs
wolf,i believe in their pack nature and in some of their personality traits.
otherreptile,"I liked the animal in a very particular/personal way, I couldn't really give a specific reason beyond 'I like it'."
wolf,Wolves are commonly associated with wisdom and loyalty. Goats are often a symbol of male sexuality and power. I've an incredibly assertive yet thoughtful and compassionate personality. I feel both animals mesh well with this.
otherprimate,"Sloth because I'm sedentary and people call me slothful.
Bonobo because I admire their society. And just wish I was one!"
wolf,best fit my personality and specific character traits
tiger,I like how they look.
wolf,"I align well with the aspects of their behavior. I have intrinsic trust of my friends, and anyone who I deem to be part of my 'pack'. I will leap into the very depths of hell for them, and I expect they'd do the same. I take loyalty and trust very seriously, and once someone has betrayed those I find it impossible to forgive them. At the same time, I am proud and independent. Even away from my friends, I'm not bothered by it much, though I do better in a social environment. "
wolf,Just seems fitting to my personality.
wolf,"I identify with wolves mostly because I act very much like a puppy at times, always begging attention from those I love and care for. They say my brown eyes and hair make my 'puppy' look that much harder to resist as it does actually make me look like a shaved pup. I identify with grown wolves because I am territorial with my mate and space. I don't like my space invaded and will fight for it. I also know I would choose without hesitation to be a wolf rather than human. I don't normally use my leopard form, but when I do I just feel.. Feline. I don't know how to describe it, I appologise. But in personality I am predatory like, and fierce in my commitment to friends, family, and my lovers."
kangaroo,"I chose my fursona's species based off of the symbolism surrounding the animal, as well as my personal history surrounding the animal and symbolisms of it that are more specific to me."
rabbit,Not for any particular reason.

othercanine,characteristics
otherdog,"No, just my favourite."
lizard,"They are strong, versatile and independent. Mostly solitary creatures. "
lizard,I completes a part of me ( the way I see my identity )
domesticcat,"There are a lot of similiarity i think. between me and a normal cat. Lazyness. i like to cuddle. i like if things are the same often and i dislike ""hunting"" for food ;P"

hyaena,I'm just drawn to them.
wolf,"Yes wolves are majestic creature that are misunderstood, just like i am misunderstood sometimes."

dragon,I didn't want to be one of the many wolves or foxes and Dragons are awesome
horse,I'm very horselike in my behavior and mind
redfox,"I feel comfortable in the context of those animals, particularly physically and in the way I act. I feel uncomfortable having to think of myself as completely human, I feel incomplete without a tail or larger, animalistic ears."
otherfox,"It's ire and its lke me, fast, sly, and cute :3"
tiger,"I choose the tiger for my most predominant personality because, I pounce, I nuzzle, I purr from time to time, and am just very bouncy person. But I can also be shy and very to myself. 

My smaller and very rare personality of dominance is shown by the Dragon. A tall muscular who is not afraid of anything. He doesn't come out much."
redfox,Tiny and slutty.
hyaena,"Pack-/group-mentality, laughter and lightness of heart"
redfox,"The red fox is my spirit guide, and I also believe that I share many traits with the fox."
husky,The closest animal to wolf but with less wild spirit.
otherbear,Yes but its too complicated to explain.
redfox,"According to many people I know, I have traits not unlike those two- personality-wise, that is. I've been told I even prance, and I guess it didn't take long for me to start identifying with both of them.
(The domestic cat is, to be more specific, a Moggie.)"
othermustelid,"They are curious animals who tend to keep to themselves, they are very passionate creatures and so that's something I respect, and they've got cute masks."
seaotter,"I identify strongly with the element of Water, I love to swim, I love seafood, I'm rather fuzzy, and I think otters are some of the cutest damned things in existence. "

cheetah,Always loved dragons and felines.
wolf,"With the canines I selected, I identify with them because of their strength and courage, as well as their social behaviors.  With the felines, I identify with them because I have very good balance, almost always landing on my feet, walking stealthily on my toes easily, and very good night vision.  I identify with the dragon because of their benevolence and wisdom (Eastern dragons are very wise and benevolent) and their massive strengths."
redfox,"Not particularly. I don't actually strongly associate myself with a fursona, but I've chosen a red fox for a while now."
husky,Yes. As a child I had a dream where I looked in the mirror and saw my furry persona (furson) standing in the place of my reflection.
panther,"I consider panthers to be very graceful, very attractive animals."
collie,"Mostly I just like border collies. I also consider my work and my play to be equally important, I enjoy affection, and I consider myself to be a loyal person."
otherfeline,"i associate felines with the blend of soft, playful, fierce, independent, and of course sensual thanks to catwoman. canine is a close second for me, but i generally consider them a bit more rugged and rough than what i often relate with, thanks to werewolves."
husky,Yes.
dragon,Dragons are fucking awesome.
othermustelid,Is a rare species (like me) and has connection with Ireland and Scotland.
othermusteloid,i think they are cool (as i use to own two ferrets) and i loved them both

wolf,"love the animal looks, and their feel of strength and independence."

I think."
redfox,Seems to fit my RL personality
otherfox,"I am  Fennec fox I choose this because I'm a huge fox lover and they suite my personality. Sly, cunning, hyper, and aggressive if forced to be as well as smart fighters."
husky,"No, just like it"
panther,"I identify with the panther because it suits my personality and if I were to envision myself as any anthromorphic (Or feral for that matter) species, that is what I would look best as. Panthers are cool, calm, mostly independent, quiet until the kill in made (Goal is reached, in my situations.) And they are strong as well. Nobody really want's to mess with them. They look soft and cuddly on the outside, but on the inside is pure, unadulterated muscle and killer instincts. But best of all, along with that muscle, goes a brain. They are intelligent! All of that describes me. If not..a bit primal. That's why I myself identify as a panther."
riverotter,"Lithe and fun-loving, but protects others. "
horse,"A wild personality, somewhat random and charming too."

germanshepherd,"I speak with a deep tone, voice, usually not heard from people my age"
dragon,"The dominant nature, the strength, the intelligence, the flight, and lastly the life length."
otherfeline,"I like both reptiles and felines as my favorite animals, so, my fursona is a mix of the two."
mouse,"I love rodents and think they're quite cute. I also have a nervous and skittish personality, and am very small statured. I chose a mouse instead of a rat because I prefer drawing really big ears."
arcticfox,"There is no particular reason, I can see my fursona as any of those chosen. Don't know what it is aside from the fact that I'd love to own any of them."
greyfox,"I identify with foxes because of their cleverness, slyness, and, of course, adorableness c:"

otherfeline,I believe the red fox to be my spirit animal though I feel more connected with the silver mutation of the red foxes for some reason and I have many cat and fox like qualities. 
wolf,No particular reason. But there are some attributes that I do identify with it.
redfox,"Shark because I have always loved water and felt misunderstood by others.

wolf,I love canines and my last name is the name of a dog. 
arcticfox,"I can be playful (in a non-sexual manner) and also lazy. I can be very energetic, or very tired. I'm fairly sporadic in my level of energy throughout the day, and I'm also very much in love with cold weather."
domesticcat,"Cats are smart, complex, kind of mysterious. But also lazy, contemplative. I study philosophy, so I pretty much dig those subjects and people also see me as complex. I prefer to spend time alone, though I have a social side I collabore with when necessary. Not to mention that cats are attractive in appearance, though that's more of an admired feature than a feature I share..."
wolf,"I choose the animals above, mainly because ever since childhood, I have had dreams or ""Visions"" of myself as feral, anthro, or bipedal forms of these creatures. And the Dark Wolf I mentioned is my newest connection to the animal world."
othercanine,"Dingo, because I've always liked their nature, the get on well with man."
lion,"I grew up with the Lion King and through a Lion King related role-play site, I discovered the furry fandom.  Being a lion has always just 'felt' right and I was somewhat romantically and emotionally connected to the characters in the Lion King."
dragon,"Simply because I've always liked them, and because they afford a large amount of creative freedom, given that they are imaginary. "
redfox,FOXES ARE CUTE
redfox,When I was in middle school I had an awesome dream that I met a fox in my backyard.  I started to hear my parents making breakfast and realized I was waking up from a dream.  Still thinking in dream logic I tried to carry him out of the dream into real life.  Looking back on this now I think in a way he did persist as a part of my own personality.

I also Identify as a Collie, because I'm Playfully, and I can be a Rule beaker."
dragon,"I just happen to like dragons, dolphins are my favorite animals and I feel strongly towards dolphins. Hearing about the killings in Taiji can actually alter my mood and kill my day."
tiger,Yes my Siberian tiger picked me and help change my life and mayed me less shy and I now act more like my tiger than human. 
otherdog,"My dominant ""species"" tends toward the canine spectrum, I have always sat in awe and admiration of wolves and other canines for their strength and loyalty. I believe that if I were to physically appear as my soul does, i would at least be partially canine of not dominantly."
otherfeline,Was a discussion with a friend when I was newer to the fandom. Had originally chosen a tiger though when I asked her she said I'd make a good Ocelot.

I also have multiple traits for 1 or more of these animals."

wolf,I just really like wolves.
wolf,"I have been a wolf Therian for over 18 years, I consider that more a Therotype than a fursona. I have a Crux fursona for my interaction with the community. I like the Crux for their energetic fun nature."
horse,"The location I live in, and it's behavior, my the Chinese  zodiac animal, or my MLP: FiM OC"
lizard,"I have always admired reptiles, both mythical and real, and while I do not specifically have an avatar or 'fursona' I associate with them quite strongly."
dragon,"Dragons are seen as wiser, more powerful and generally spiritual being in the east. Western Dragons are slowly beginning to come around with the same view. I find them almost Godlike.."
dragon,"i've always loved dragons, ever since my childhood. so far before i learned of the furry fandom I've had an interest. then when i got more and more familiar with the furries i started to work on my personal fursona (or scalesona, cause it has scales) and the first thing that popped in mind was a dragon."

wolf,The wolf has ben my imaginary friend trugh scool as my only friend couse I was bullyed alot.
otherfox,"Not really. Nidorina fits me very well, and the fennec fox just looks cute."
dragon,"I look up to dragons as being a symbol of courage and strength. They are also seen as protectors. I believe dragons are misunderstood, so i can relate in that way"
wolf,i can be gentle and kind like a dog but can snap like a wolf when provoked 
redfox,Fox otherkin.
dragon,"According to the Chinese calendar, my symbol is the Dragon. While I don't actually believe in astrology or any other superstition, I do find that kind of cool. That was my initial reason for choosing a dragon as my online 'sona, but it's moved towards the fact that since dragons are mythical, they can be whatever you want them to be. I can make mine reflect my interests and my views and not violate any laws of nature. The fact that dragons are usually depicted as intelligent creatures that have generous capabilities only enforces the appeal of their power. "
kitsune,"Honestly, woke up one day with the idea in my head about a animal with multiple tails...Did a little research and it just fit. "
lion,Because of the movie The Lion King.

otherfox,happenstance
deer,"My fursona doesn't actually fit one species, but she draws her appearance mostly from a house cat, a white-tailed deer, and a nubian goat. Cats have been my favorite animal since I was young, and I collect cat items such as vintage bone china, artisan crafts, books, and plastic toys. I grew up next to a forest surrounded by deer, and I identify with their stereotypical qualities of introversion, innocence, and naivety. Nubian goats also happen to be a favorite. I love goats in general, but I love the shape of the nubian's ears. I love cloven hooved animals so my fursona has hooves as well as palm pads like a cat's."
othercanine,I've always been around dogs and I feel as if I might be like one .being part Native American my totem is the wolf so I've went on that and just stuck.i got my fursona from a game I play but design a lot different from the game just took the name which changes a little but still have the same name just mainly called the secondary one .
wolf,I'm always alone 
redfox,Similar traits that match my personality. Also one of my favorite animals. Very cute.
otherungulate,"I was specifically looking for a persona to use for a convention name/badge.  The first that felt ""right"" was a small plush moose that my wife (fiance at the time) sent me in a care package when I was in animation school.
Later added the dormouse hybrid because the moose persona is so small, and I get drowsy easily."
hyaena,Because it is my favorite animal of corse plus I always liked the three hyenas from the lion king.

wolf,fiercely loyal
otherdog,I am a dog enthusiast and created a hybrid breed as a fursona of some of my favorite dogs.
otherfeline,"I chose Feline, Other to represent Chakats. I believe that Chakats embody my spirit because I've always felt like a mixture of male and female and they are naturally hermaphroditic. I also agree with a great many of their views: such as open sexuality and free love."
tiger,"Connection at an age where I felt isolated and trapped.
I saw a tiger in a cage at the zoo, and it was yowling mournfully. Some girls in my class were making fun of it, like they made fun of me, and I realized that I felt connected to it. Like I was caged in as well."
jackal,Tremendously masculine. Aspiration towards its character
rabbit,"I am a bunny in the Chinese zodiac, and absolutely love the cuteness and fertility symbolism that comes with it."
otherfox,"Even though I am a cat lover, I have always loved wolves and foxes. I specially love the wolf's ears and the fox's fluffy tail, tho I also love the way cats purr."
rat,"Its an animal I like, both in real life and as depicted in entertainment.  It also has traits I self identify with closely.  Finally, I chose this animal over another as a matter of personal choice, heavily leaning upon choosing an animal less commonly seen in the furry fandom."
tiger,"Taken from a journal I wrote about my character name, design and a few other things:



I'm a fighter, but only when I have to be. I'm fiercely loyal to my friends and will protect them any way I can. I can be perfectly content to be alone, but I'm happier when in a group. To my mind this left only two immediate options, a Lion [for their Prides,] or a Wolf [for their Packs,] and I've always had an affinity for Canines. That, is how my anthro-wolf self came about, not because of my name or the prevalence of wolves in the fandom, but from careful thinking. The scars are just more prominent versions of scars I actually have [for instance, the eye scar, is merely an eye-brow scar on me,] the hair is the same as mine and the main colouring is based on the European wolf to reflect where I come from.

As for my other forms, the eastern-dragon came next. I decided to get Icelyon and Zen a gift as a thankyou for their friendship and I knew how much they liked “Spirited Away”. So I came up with an idea of the two of them riding dragon-Haku over a river, I tried to draw it myself and sucked royally.... so I commissioned Greenmonkey ^_^. During the sketching phase I thought about how similar his face was to that of a wolf and came up with the idea of Lonewolf being able to become an eastern dragon. Then all that remained was to add the facial scar and colour him using European wolf based colours.

Third and fourth came at the same time. My human and non-anthro-wolf solves are a result of watching Wolf's Rain and loving the very idea of the series, besides, simply put, why shouldn't you use yourself as well? Humans are animals too. [A recent change I've made to fourth form is to give him forward-pointing 7-shaped horns. This is based on the wolf-like creatures in “Monster Rancher.” He has now become “for the most part” just a differently coloured version of the character “Tiger of the Wind.”]

Fifth [and last,] we have my anthro-dragon-wolf self. This came as a result of my imagining a looping animation of my fursona shifting between his various forms and a fluid movement sequence and it simply clicked. I won't describe the animation in detail, as I have yet to find someone to make it, but I will say the order. Human > anthro-wolf > non-anthro-wolf > eastern dragon > anthro-dragon-wolf > human."
wolf,"Yeah, it's my favourite animal and cuz I do looks like act like that in my daily life"
wolf,"It can be that I'm a dog person, and its also about my spirituality, animal totems.

My fursona was actually a gift at first, and ended up keeping her, so, I guess that helped too?"
jackal,Furry characters
otherdog,It fits best for my personality.
wolf,"My fursona is an highly evolved wolf mixture, I´ve always been fascinated with wolves and enjoy their howls and behaviors. I understand how they can have such a strong social feeling towards their pack mates, but can also survive on their own for period of time. They are strong willed and strong in body.

I also identify with the rat, simply for the reason that I adore rats and always have. They too have a strong sense of social but can also survive on their own. They are intelligent, funny and can even be playful. "
dragon,"Just always been a big fan of dragons - even from a pre-furry standpoint, as a big Fantasy fan I've always loved them. Have a lot of dragon oriented clothing and merchandise - seemed to be the obvious natural progression."
wolf,"Generally the animals that I associate with myself align with my personality and what I do in my life. For example, I would consider myself a lone wolf in some aspects of my life, but sometimes I am accepted into a 'pack' (i.e. community), and am able to provide and be a positive member of such a group."
lion,"I created my fursona from my astrology, so being a Leo, combined with the other element shaped my vision of my furry persona."
otherdog,Because Dobermans.
wolf,I feel like I have similar attributes to these animals.
husky,I have very many traits in common with it.
wolf,"The wolf was something I identified with Long before I knew of the furries. I was very close with my dog growing up and felt an empathy with canines. Wolves are very unique in hat they rely on the strengths of others to be stronger together. They care very much for those close to them while still being unique individually, and looking out for themselves. 
Also I read white fang in high school and empathized with the lonlieness of feeling outcast in society. We moved to michigan when i was 10 and as one of the only Mormons in my school I did at times feel isolated as be did. 

When I went to college I found wolfs rain, which I watched, in entirety, on YouTube. I empathized with toboe being the peacemaker and keeping the group together. I was also sort o the runt in my family, the oldest but least capiable physically. In school I could never count on being able to muscle my way out of things so toboe and I had a lot in common. 

I'm also physically more like a wolf than say a bear or tiger. I'm that skinny beanpole kid that hard work will build up a little. 

While I was serving my two year mission for the church, I spent a lot I time in self reflection. As well as working in a companionship continually for the first time in my life. I also started to draw wolves consistently and wrote or was inspired with most of the werewolf writings I've done. 

It just came together at that time and I was able to admit to myself that I really do associate with wolves. 
Me and my wife have just finished hammering out the details on a wolf character that accurately reflects me. 
This is probably more information than can ever be helpful. 
"
husky,"Dominant and aggressive at times, though I'm loyal to those closest to me. I enjoy company and hate being alone. When in the mood, I'm extremely active."
otherdog,"I look like a bear, and I'm considered a bear in the gay meaning of the term. "
husky,"Playful, loyal, intelligent"
wolf,Always have even before i knew about furries i dressed up as a wolf
domesticcat,"I've always felt that I have a certain bond with cats. When I decided to join the furry fandom, it was because I wanted to try my paw at furry artwork. While learning how to draw, I found that I would use the eraser to draw as much as the pencil. From this I developed the name Erazure. Snow leopards happened to be perfect to draw in a monochrome color scheme and I have always admired their strength, beauty, and agility."
wolf,wolf and panther are spirit relations.  the others i feel more attracted to then humans.  all cats share some of my own tendencies.
domesticcat,"Love kitties, and made my character when I was 5 and a half, i'm 22 now and still have him. :3"
rabbit,Mice Predominately prefer to hide and not be paid mind. They're trouble makers and mischievous. I can totally identify with that.
wolf,It is both my spirit guide and my soul. I am a wolf inside. I am a wolf in a human skin with a human body. But my mind and my soul is a wolf. 
wolf,"My fursona is actually a hybrid character between a wolf and a human. Part of the reason I chose this combination is because I find difficulty drawing completely anthropomorphic characters. I also chose this combination because while I choose to identify with the wolf, I sometimes feel like an outsider in the fandom and I find the more human aspects of my character symbolize that. I selected the wolf option on this survey because my fursona has always been a wolf since I created it. I identify with wolves because they are viewed as strong and loyal animals, which I feel relates to my personality. Wolves are also commonly misunderstood and mistreated which is something else I easily related to."
lion,"I always think a lion suits me best since I'm a natural leader at heart, and lions are considered ""kings"" in a sense."
dragon,I like the attributes of those specific animals.
dragon,I have always loved dragons and like the vast mythology behind them and what they can range from being.
domesticcat,The reason I chose the kitty is because they are so cute and I love to be the same way they are. 
tiger,Because Tigress
pandabear,Strong Connection
dragon,"I was under heavy medication when I was 17. I started to sleep a lot (including at school) and have weird dragon related dreams, in which I would turn into one. They were always the same and I became obsessed by dragons, started to draw them all the time and had to own every dragon related object, game, book or movie.

I then became a furry and obviously choose a dragon as my fursona."
wolf,Wolves are awesome. I identify with them and they've always been my favorite animal. 
redfox,I just like them. Ever since I was a kid.
wolf,"The wolf for solitude and the hunting mindset, always on the lookout and shy/undisclosed to people I don't know or trust and the husky for it's playfulness and companionship and to some extend, the destructive behaviour of a few of them. "
wolf,It's been my favorite animal since I was a child. I've always been a loner and I just generally like wolves and hellhounds.
otherungulate,"I identify with a deer because they're my favorite animals. 
I identify with a boar because they are my animal guides and I feel a spiritual connection to them."
tiger,I am like a dragon
rabbit,"Rabbit - timidity, social anxiety, lateness and poor organisational skills (Alice in Wonderland)

Dog - playful, silly, perceived (incorrectly) as outgoing"
husky,"I really love huskies, and my astrological sign is Leo."
domesticcat,"I've always loved vampires and cats. So I also thought about the fact that I wonder how it's like to fly and the fact that I have a feeling to stay up all night. My choosing is also from how I always wanted to look like. Creating this fursona of mine, gives something to look at and what I could be, personality and weight wise. I'm overweight so creating characters that are thin and beautiful helps me also create a self image that I will and can become that. "
redfox,I loved foxes as far back as I can remember.
horse,Uncomplicated yet highly strung
collie," well when i asked around to non furry friends, what aniaml i would be i kpt getting the two so i mixed them and i got me~!"
othercanine,"I have always loved canines, but wanted to give my fursona a bit of a twist."
dragon,"im cunning and sneaky like a fox

I relate to a dragon because ill protect those close to me "
wolf,"As a Therian, I am a wolf."
leopard,"Strong, solitary, smart."
dragon,"I think its something I've been drawn to since I was very young, for all the reasons a child is drawn to such a thing. On top of that I have been a fan of all reptiles since just as young an age. When coupled with my love of flight, a dragon was perfect."
otherungulate,"I've always felt I had an affinity with unicorns, most likely due to the fact that I rather identified with a certain unicorn character during one of my more serious bouts of depression.
However, I always knew that I would never be worthy enough to call myself a unicorn, as I held them in the highest regard.

The soul searching went on for years after that, and I eventually found the Kirin.  It just felt right.  The power, the grace, the serenity, the mystery....it just fit."
raccoon,"Not so common as to be cliche, not so uncommon as to be almost as cliched. Plus they're urban, native to North America, and other such things."
lion,"A desire to embody the regal traits lions are symbolized with, but in a practical sense due to my childhood love for The Lion King."
wolf,the wolf is mu soul 
domesticcat,"Characteristic
Stealthiness 
"
raccoon,"I feel I have aspects of both a wolf and a raccoon.  Seeing as I'm also often self-conflicted, this may explain a few things.  The two have a lot of conflicting traits."
wolf,The Grizzly bear and the timber wolf are my spirit guides 
wolf,"No, not really , the only reason is i like these animals alot."
otherdog,"For dog, it's more on a personality basis. I admire the loyalty and general upbeat attitude."
redfox,"Im overly cautious like a wolf, but when i open up im as playful as a fox"
bat,I really admire bats.
otherfeline,not really 
arcticfox,not really
skunk,"I am a skunk because of my love for long fluffy tails.  For the first five years of my involvement with the fandom, my chosen fursona was that of a fox (vixen).  My original decision of fox over skunk was due to society's conceptions of the two animals.  After being involved with the fandom for five years, I reevaluated the two and found that I'm more like a skunk than I am like a fox.  

Foxes are predators.  I am a vegetarian.

Within the fandom, foxes have a reputation of being overly sexually active.  My mind may be as deep in the gutter as a fox's mind is said to be, but I'm not as quick to jump into bed with someone, as most foxes are said to be.  I love to flirt!

I may have a nimble wit, but I'm slow and lumbering otherwise.  

In the wild, skunks tend to follow a ""do no harm"" policy.  They leave all of the other animals alone (except for invertebrates. They eat things such as grubs and bees).  If they are threatened by another animal, their defense mechanism is a spray that does not do any permanent damage (except, maybe to clothing).  

All of the feminine skunks that I have met have been born biologically male, including myself. I have entered more on this topic at the end of the survey."
arcticfox,"I chose the arctic fox as a base for my fursona because of its appearance and habitat.  I really like the appearance of foxes in general, but I also prefer colder environments."
husky,"The horse resembles my masculinity, the bear resembles my strength, my stalwart attitude and being a panda, and a red panda, would resemble my uncontrollable need to express my love and positivity with other people, the dragon represents my powerful sense of imagination and my mental skills. And finally the Feline and Cannine species represent my devious parts and thoughts, my passion, my pride, my anger and my indepedence."
wolf,"It mainly fits my personality, as I prefer to be the strong, silent type who can let his guard down when around close friends and people he can trust. I usually try to keep a grouping of friends that I consider close moderately small, but very trustworthy."
rat,Yes many reasons
domesticcat,"There's a variety of reasons. Firstly I think that it suits my personality on several levels. The good and the bad. But mostly, it always seemed like the right fit for me. I tried other fursonas and they just didn't seem to fit quite like being a cat."
redfox,Foxes are cool lol
dragon,I personally feel a connection to reptiles because I don't like cold weather and I like hot weather. In dragons because of the hidden power and mystery. Water dragon specifically because I feel at my best in the water.
wolf,I've always loved wolves and their waysof lives as animals/
wolf,Several real life experiences/interactions with wolves in the wild.
redfox,"Favorite animal- they are a fun mixture of curious and colorful. I would love to have one as a pet, if Texas law would allow me, but it does not. (Texas law does not let you keep fur-bearing animals as pets, and since fox fur is used in jackets/etc, I cannot have one.)"
horse,Brony fandom is a subset of furry fandom.
riverotter,"I do not identify with the persona above, but I do consider it a complement to my own personality for when I'm bored or lonely. Pretty much, an imaginary friend that I know isn't real, but like to keep around to keep around to daydream. "
wolf,"Wolf - I like them, have strong affinities to them.

Bat - I think they're very interesting critters."
wolf,I feel I should have been born as one. Or WAS one in a past life.

tiger,I like cats.
othercanine,I feel it fits my personality.
wolf,I love wolves. my  favorite animal
redfox,"No particular reason, I just like traits of foxes and raccoons."
tiger,"I've always had a love and appreciation for cats both Big and domestic. Tigers strike me as being the most interesting, they way they hunt, the way they interact with one another.
They command such a sense of awe and apprehension, Its hard to ignore them. They get a lot of attention from media and activists, yet the still have a sense of mystery to them.
Strong, Smart, Noble, Fierce, Enigmatic, Tigers truly are fascinating. Plus they look cool."
rabbit,"bunnies are clever, cute, cautious and they can act fast if needed, those are qualities i like"
dragon,"Silver Dragons are good aligned, noble, strong, proud and protective of those they love.  They are also temperamental and easily angered, particularly when faced with injustice.

kangaroo,"I'm not really sure.
It's just what felt right for my character."
redfox,"I do not identify with my fursona; in fact, I am not even sure he should be dubbed a fursona. He is simply a character that really has nothing to do with me at all besides reflecting a few features of my personality. "
hyaena,"I identify strongly with gnolls (hyena hybrids with a dash of demonic blood). as such, I identify with hyenas as animals too, very strongly."
wolf,"Probably because of my appearance, a strong liking of physical exercise and a love for my family and close friends. Also, for me wolves represent the traits which I value a lot, such as loyalty. They are also a representation of freedom, which is very important for me as well."
wolf,"Dogs are Friendly, Caring, and loving i share some of the same personality traits as a dog."
wolf,"I relate to the Canine/wolf aspect due to my primal nature in every day life. also because I tend to act like quite the pup when I'm playful. 

I relate to the Dragon side of it due to my ferocity in situations of protecting others. I also tend to have a bit of mystery around me, and can scare the crap out of someone if they piss me off."
snowleopard,I like the snow.
wolf,I feel drawn to each one of my choices because I can identify with characteristics and They feel right. I have been a dragon since I was very young. My dragon character is the portrayal of my past life as a dragon.
redfox,I don't honestly know. I've always loved foxes. I feel strange going into the furry fandom and seeing it so saturated with other foxes and fox-lovers. 
domesticcat,Seemed to make sense
dragon,"I always loved the idea of dragons. fire breathing creatures of power gifted with wisdom and granted wisdom that was overwhelming. to try to embody even a portion of that would be marvelous to me. as well, i enjoy the warm smooth feeling of scales."
panther,"Canines because of their Loyalty to their pack, their family, Panther because of their ability to move unseen and unheard through the Jungle, and the Bird of Prey because of my Extremely good eyesight"
wolf,"I love Canines (how they act, feel, and behave in real life), and I think they look cool."

otherfeline,My facial hair at the time.
wolf,"I have just always found traits of mine that match with that animla, more like it chose me than I chose it."
wolf,Just feel it as right match
dragon,"Western dragons, in some renditions, possess a combination of pleasing aesthetic traits and a familiar level of intelligence, in addition to flight. While I don't believe myself to be a dragon in any way, sometimes I fantasize about what it would be like to be one. While it would probably be a negative experience in reality, in the confines of an imaginative fantasy universe it probably wouldn't be so bad. I'd like it."
deer,Personal behaviours and appearance :3
othermustelid,"I wanted an uncommon animal that wasn't glamorous, wasn't an obvious attempt to be different, could have black and white markings predominantly, and could easily be illustrated with a superhero-esque mask. "
domesticcat,"I chose a cat because I like cats as they like to lounge around, eat, sleep and likes to be stroked, same as me.

Pikachu- At the time of creation, Pikachu was my favourite Pokemon.

Mobian hedgehog- I chose to be a Mobian hedgehog because I once imagined myself as a Sonic character so I can imagine myself in the Sonic game, Sonic Adventure."
wolf,I see wolves as having reason.
redfox,"I am a Dog on the Chinese Zodiac but also a cat person, so I chose ""the Catlike Canine."""

othermustelid,"Ferrets are very energetic, hyperactive, very flexible, curious as a cat, happy-go-lucky, playful as a pup, clumsy, funny, silly, love to sleep and eat alot. And ocasionally cuddling.

redfox,"Intelligent, cunning, mysterious, and just an intriguing creature"

dragon,"I feel that my Spirit Guide is a dragon, and I've always been strangely attracted to them (I believe that it was Jordayne, my Spirit Guide, pushing me in that direction)."
panther,Not a conscious one.
othercanine,"I chose it [Folf, Fox/Wolf] my first character before I knew what furry even was on Furcadia was named Foxblood. I also feel I have the integrity of a wolf and the shyness of a fox."
coyote,I like Wile E. Coyote and have encountered coyotes in the wild. Also native stories about the coyote.

otherungulate,"My primary 'self' is a cheetah-mountain goat hybrid.

For many years -- most of my ""furry life"" cheetah was my fursona.

A combination of things all at once lead to picking Mountain Goat for a fursona.  I was in a really bad marriage with an abusive wife, and I would go hiking as often as possible ... getting outside helped me feel better.  I was on a hike with friends, and I was jumping around atop some rocks on a cliff and one of my friends shouted, ""Get down from there, you crazy mountain goat!""  It kind of stuck.  I learned more about mountain goats, really loved 'em.

After the divorce, I no longer really felt the cheetah self.  My ex wife had done a lot to destroy that 'persona' ... so my post-divorce new-self, I picked mountain goat as a base, and added cheetah spots as sort of a nod to where I came from whilst looking ahead to where I'm going :)"
coyote,It's been with me all my life
otherdog,"My personality traits, though I have some traits of other animals I tend to be indecisive but always revert back to a dog so I stick with a dog."
othermustelid,"I particularly enjoy Meerkats because of their close knit communities, and their quirkiness. "
germanshepherd,"German Shepherds are loyal, proud, and protective. I love them for this and like to think I have these same aspects "

husky,"not really.
"
otherdog,Just feels right!
othermarsupial,I was born in Australia and biblies/bandicoots are my favorite animals

The Demon Dragon as it's my own creative species, showing somewhat my creative side."
redfox,"I don't really know why, I just always have."
husky,I believe I fit the personality traits of my fursona.
wolf,"Not entirely sure.  Started making my fursona slightly before (5 years prior?) I knew that furry was a thing, and I think the wolf thing was part of the werewolf druid for D&D, and I had role played that I got stuck in werewolf form... and was... a purple werewolf. "
redfox,Each of my characters are a 90% representation of me. My fox character and I share the most common traits.
coyote,"Friends told me that a coyote fits me, and I agreed.
The opinion was partially based on the Native American perception of the Coyote as a trickster god."
dragon,I'm an otherkin dragon at heart.
redfox,favourite animal
otherdog,Sort of. I started playing an anthro welsh corgi in a Dungeons & Dragons game before I joined the furry fandom and something about that character really resonated with me.
cheetah,No
wolf,I like to stay with other individuals but also stay in loneliness if i am in that mood. I like balancing things and equality at 360°
otherdog,"A poodle, because I have long been a Francophile and like to promote the power, might and style of the noble poodle."
redfox,"Both the common common ness and the uniqueness. Foxes are often misunderstood as to their nature, and I associate with their unique quirks more. Also, foxes aren't entirely Canine, and have lots of cat features to them that set them apart from dogs."
horse,"Other than physical characteristics, such as beauty and elegance, I think the horse as archetype brings a lot of significant symbols and ideas. Also, I feel somehow similar to horses attitude in my personality."
arcticfox,because if u meet me you will know why i am a fox. i fits me the best =^_^=
domesticcat,I was inspired by my own cat that I have.
wolf,Well I like wolves and foxes.  Wolves are like me because if you hurt one of my pups I hurt you.  Foxes because I can be very sneaky and like to pull tricks on my friends.

othermustelid,Herpestes auropunctatus are the coolest critters with four feet and fur

redfox,I felt like I was always a fox. I am a bit sly and sneaky. 
wolf,"About the dragon, I mostly have a special bonding with it, being my first fursona. I then changed it to wolf, mostly for finding in my attitude some traits that could be compared to wolfs' behaviour. And I like canines. And wolfs."
otherdog,"Small body, domesticated."
wolf,"Wolves are very loyal to those they care for and I am very much like that and I have a close knit group of friends similiar to a pack such as wolves
Husky wise I can be very playful and energetic and sometimes spastic"
riverotter,fits me
wolf,"I like the pack structure and attitude wolves have and overall, more than anything else, have always had an unexplained pull and affinity toward them."
otherdog,"Nah not really. I just think that most canines are easier to draw than most other animals.
, so I figured I might as well make my fursona something I would enjoy drawing often."
otherreptile,"I think it fits my personality, and I feel a sort of connection to alligators."
snowleopard,I have always identified with large cats (even before I was a furry and didn't know what it meant) currently I identify with Snow Leopards the most currently because of difficulties I've had in life that are like trying to hunt on a mountain side.  Most people (furry or otherwise) however state that I am a cat in my movements and my gaze.
coyote,"I've always identified with the Trickster archetype, often acting and presenting myself in ways that are deceptive, though not in a malicious manner; I often intentionally give mixed signals to catch people off guard and observe their reactions when their expectations are not met, or are drastically changed. While not a prankster, I do actively attempt to trick people into revealing more about themselves than they're willing; however, unlike most Trickster interpretations, I do not act to further personal gains or a hidden agenda, but to find truth, both for myself and for the other person. Even if that means tricking them into finding it."
otherfox,Just an animal I feel I have traits with.
otherfeline,"Layman's:
Yes, due to it being a part of my spirituality. 

Actuality:
I have very vivid lucid dreams, in which I am some non-terran (earthen) spotted cat. The closest i've come to identifying it is the Ocelot, So I am an ocelot. This goes along with all details to my.. 'fursona'."
othercanine,"It's a feeling, hardly a reason."
tiger,"I have always liked tigers, even when I was very young. I've also always had cats and I have some feline-ish behaviors. Tigers are the largest and most powerful feline, and I've always found them beautiful, majestic, and awe inspiring. When I discovered the fandom, and learned what it actually meant to be a furry, I knew immediately that tigers were what I most identified with. Tigers are the most impressive, visually and physically, of all felines, and felines I've always admired over all other animals."
germanshepherd,no
dragon,"I like scales over fur, and being able to fly would be amazing."
coyote,I feel it suits my personality.
horse,"I've always had a love for horses since childhood, especially after joining a riding stable as a kid."
domesticcat,"Cats are nimble and creative, yet tend to be lazy.
And I've always had a strange connection to foxes. They're, honestly, such wonderful and adorable creatures!"
deer,"I have always admired deer, and their antlers. I've also always associated with canines."
domesticcat,I just like cats =) 
othermusteloid,I really don have a fursona though I feel that i should. I like to day dream my self like some of the animal i select like feline or mustelids
husky,"Yes. Huskies are tough to gain your trust, but once they do, they are extremely loyal. I tend to close my personal life to people and shun most people out of my life, but once you gain my friendship and trust, I would take a bullet for you. 

I also enjoy their looks and colors."
wolf,i just like the animal
wolf,"don't know, I just see myself in some of the animals"
redfox,I love foxes. O.o

wolf,i feel as if i was born that animal
pandabear,It's cute.
wolf,"Love Wolves, They're endangered, and I believe we can prevent their extinction if people tried a little harder. "
cheetah,"The cheetah Is very lean like me, it tends to have fluctuations in behaviour between hyper (aka active) and passive (aka chill)"
wolf,I believe that posses attributes of all three of the animals
otherfox,"Foxes have always drawn me in. The balance between feline grace and canine strength, their solitary lives, but most of all, how they're portrayed in myth and legend. Be it kitsune, disguised gods, guardian of the stars, never is a fox considered to be a lesser creature."
dragon,"It is who I am, It also fits well to who I am humanly. Strongly misunderstood but also can be the softest of the rest. Its the heart, not the body."

otherfeline,I feel they possess traits that I see in myself
dragon,Life -long connection to dragons
tiger,Rats are great survivors and highly intelligent and adaptable problem solvers. This appeals to me.
wolf,Wolfs I find are rather misunderstood. They are very shy and like to keep to themselves but they are very loyal to their pack. I am very she and I am rather scared of people but I do like to be around friends that understand me. That is why I identify with wolves and that is my persona
wolf,i love wolves and believe that many of my personal traits are like the traits of a wolf.
dragon,"I believe I have the spirit of a wolf, and I also really like dragons. So I am a dragon wolf hybrid "
otherfeline,"No not really, just what I wanted my fursona to be."
domesticcat,My friends have always called me a kitten due to the way I mewl when yawning and the random sounds and stretches I do in daily life.

dragon,I just have always day dreamed of being a dragon since my earliest memories.  I couldn't give a reason why.
wolf,"I've always loved animals, especially canines and more especially wolves, this was strongly imbeded into me when I was at a zoo a few years back. My teacher at the time had a father that owned said zoo, we were having a tour around the place and helped cleanign their snow leopard cages and hung up food for their lions, was really cool. We were there for an entire weekend, so the first night we slept in a house adjacent to their large wolf pen. During the evening we got to see them feed the wolves, majestic creaturs really, that felt amazing watching. But it doesn't stop there, we sleept the night in that house, which had a really large panoramic window into the wolves pen, which I decided to sleep as close into as possible. The morning when I awoke everybody was staring at me, I wondered why and one of them told me to turn around with an excited look on their face. And when I turned around there was sitting a wolf just behind me, looking straight at me, if the glass wasn't there it would basically be in my face. It looked at me and I felt something within me, unsure what but I have my ideas. Since that day I've felt something more between me and wolves or canines in general, like they were friends or family even."
otherdog,"I like to catch balls and lick my boyfriends face^^
and more things offcorse. "
otherdog,"Dog mongrel,dye mostly votes and because i wasborn in 1994,dog yea rin chinese calendar"

dragon,"Yes, I am a fan of Spore, therefore I represent the fandom as a Spore Species."
wolf,"I identify with the wolf because they are effective as a group as well as by themselves, although slightly less so. They are able to endure sever conditions, yet care for one another deeply."
kitsune,"I'm not sure, I like the cunning nature"
wolf,My birth name means Wolf Council
dragon,"People listen to and respect Dragons, and the rattlesnake is from the desert, as I am, and is the symbol on the 'Don't Tread On Me' flag."
othercanine,Cleaver but submissive. Best looking.
otherbird,"I find finches (The species of my character) to be sweet birds which can be violent if you treat them in a way you don't like. They are also small and timid, like me."

wolf,Not really.. I don't even remember why I chose wolf
rabbit,"Because I have like the Hare, and because we have similar comportament"
kangaroo,It just seemed to fit suit.
kitsune,"I originally admire the attribute of a fox that is sly, clever and quiet.
but as time goes on I've also picked up some other personality such as a canine loyalty, and a cat's carefree attitude.

Of course as time goes on I've also became more open to the  fox's ""slut"" side of the stereotype, then again, so does every furry."
otherbear,I believe the Bear to be my Totem Animal. The lion is a favored aspect. 
kitsune,"Not really, it just most showed what my fursona was most likely needed to accomplish my dream of it

"
wolf,"Ferious, loyal, & pack oriented. What is there to admire."
wolf,"Species that I like. Like bats, I enjoy the night. Like wolves, I'm loyal to my group of friends. "
raptor,"I chose several:
- Jackal, cheetah, and dragon are all OCs that I use to represent parts of me that I sometimes wish were more prevalent
- Wolf, cheetah, and turtle all are all animals that I feel match parts of my personality (to varying degrees)
--- Wolf from the (admittedly inaccurate) ""lone wolf"" connotation - I'm incredibly introverted, though I do wish I had a pack.  Bird or prey for the same reason.
--- Cheetah from an article I read long ago comparing gifted individuals to ""cheetahs in a world of lions"".  (Also, I just think they're really cool and unique.)
--- Turtle/tortoise from the introversion (again); probably a better representation than a ""lone wolf"". Also as I've been (friendly) teased as being a crotchety old man in a young man's body, and I think the turtle/tortoise fits the wrinkled, grumpy old man stereotype well. X-D"
wolf,I felt as if this was the right choice.
squirrel,My personality and mannerisms seem to mesh well with the typical stereotypical impression of the species. It seemed like a no-brainer to choose.
dragon,I feel like I was a dragon or am a dragon spiritually. It is a deeply rooted and lasting feeling about myself.
wolf,"My actions and traits my entire life fit the three animals that make up me. I am mostly canine-like, growling, protecting my food, seeing my friends as part of my group that I need to protect even when they aren't around me, etc. I am Lynx like in how I slink around and my flexible and fluid movements. (as well as having the power without looking like I have that power)

And I am part dragon because I know so much about them and it accounts for my mood markings and darker side of me. (Fur darkens, tail seems to slender down, black marking appears on my back, etc)"
otherbird,"Well. Black-capped Chickadees are common in my area, I think they're adorable, and they are fun to RP because they're so damn tiny. Do I identify with it? Not really"
wolf,"I love wolves and feel like I have a spiritual connection with them, and they are my favorite animal.  Members of my family love wolves. I am familiar with dog and wolf behavior. I also have Wolf Tribe Cherokee Indian in my bloodline"
tiger,It just came to me one day.
redfox,"Much like the red fox, I have red fur (hair), and my personality matches that of a fox- generally playful and positive, but serious when I need to be."
redfox,"Foxes are clever, resourceful, and sneaky. And they are not considered useful or valuable by other people. They live on the fringe."
redfox,"I sort of grew up with star fox, and even though hes not red, It still resonated with me. Also I just think they are sooooo coooool!"
wolf,Spirit Animal
raptor,"I relate a cat because of the way that I move, and the way that I have a sense of lazy swagger throughout life. I relate to a crow or raven because I am intellectual, cunning, and a trickster. I relate to a bird of prey, my fursona is an owl, again because of both my intellectual and philosophical sides, I love the night, and want nothing more than to fly."
otherungulate,i wanted something that wasn't too common.
horse,"Wolf- I'm almost exactly like a wolf.
Red Fox- I'm a bit of trickster
Arctic Fox-I love the cold.
River Otter- I'm very laid back most of the time. I just kind of go with the flow of things.
Housecat- I'm very lazy and I love napping.
Tiger- I'm pretty scary when angry.
Horse- I love to run, completely wild and free.
Bird (Other)- I love the sensation of flying.
Monkey- I love to climb."
wolf,"Among the many animals I like, I most often come back to identifying with wolves, because of their appearance, their intelligence, their independence, and the close familial bond they share with each other."
horse,"I'm strong, smart, peaceful, and more connected with nature."
polarbear,"Bear, because I'm a big lovable fat guy and every loves hugging me. Tiger because I'm protective and tigers ROCK! Others see me as a tiger more than a bear. Cat because I love cats and I love to meow. Cow because I like cows. Panthers because my character and female motherly side is a panther. "
dragon,The wolf i do identify with because its all about the pack. Team work! I love that as well as the way a werewolf looks is awesome. I identify with dragons because of their power strength and both are misunderstood a lot in grand scale. Wolves are seen as fearsome creatures that kill and eat. And dragons are seen as terrifying bringers of disaster.  
othercanine,"Yes. Behavioral traits such as loyalty, wariness of others, needing to be social with others like me, ect."
seaotter,"The animals I choose to identify with, all share qualities that I feel I have, though mysterious at times, I find myself being more inclined to be both a canine (wolf/coyote/jackal) and the bird (raven) pairing due to their rich history together. Both native Americans and aboriginal folklore account of the bird and dog helping each other to survive and how they need each other in a mutual beneficial relationship. I find one half of me is the bird (calculating/soaring/perfectionist) and the other half is the canine (group player/teacher/guide/instinctual/trickster). Both balancing each other out and both needing each other to survive this harsh world we live in."
greyfox,"I'm not entirely sure why I identify with the grey fox, it's just always been 'me' I suppose"
husky,"They are strong, free, and diligent. "
dragon,I feel close to this creature as I have always been very interested in it.
otherdog,I'd love to be a dog. There's no further reason.
otherdog,"I have always thought that being a lone wolf in real life was a similar attribute to the said animal. I also have a strong compassion with friends, and am very loyal, like a dog."
wolf,Always liked wolves.
othercanine,No
otherdog,"I love the symbolism associated with dogs (kindness, fidelity and loyalty) even if in fact it isn't always true. And I like the strong personality dogs have."
redfox,similar traits in actions and personality
coyote,Species native to the area I grew up in. Have an affinity for canines.
redfox,"I've always had a weird attraction for foxes, I think it's some kind of crossed wire in by brain."
other,Because I give my fursonas personalities based off of myself.
husky,"I have a connection with huskies. I have hazel eyes and some of them do too, I usually look after several of them too so I get on well with them and they get on well with me."
wolf,"An extrapolation of ""lone wolf,"" due to a very introverted childhood."
germanshepherd,German Shepherds are my favorite breed of dog and I love horses.
wolf,"I dunno really, there is just something majestic about wolves."
deer,"Foxes, Deer, and Cats, have always been extremely special animals to me.  Each have elegance and beauty in a different way, and have traits that I wish, mentally, I could get more clearly into my head.  I would not say I chose these animals to represent me, but that they represent me so well, it's as if they chose me."
otherfeline,"Since i was little, i always had cat like tendencies. "
horse,There are attributes I personally like about the choosen animals.
dragon,Rabbits are social and dragons are jacks of all traits. My fursona is a combination of the two in order to encompass all of me.
lizard,They are my totem animals fused into one being.
redfox,"Foxes are on the smaller side, and their bodies are sleek with long limbs. I have a similar body type. They are usually portrayed as being sly, crafty, intelligent  and deceiving. I like to think that I have those qualities as well. I also just flat out love foxes!"
lion,"Attributes seem fitting, and I often feel that my responses to certain life situations reflect the behaviour of lions, even though I take my own spin on it and don't conform entirely to the general ""lion"" stereotype."
wolf,I've always been attached to wolves. Any dog I owned was as close to a wolf as possible and I always wanted shirts with wolves as a kid. I have artwork of wolves around my home and I always feel at peace when I look at them. I've always been loyal to my family and would most certainly defend them in any situation. I adopt people into my family when it comes to furries because I want to protect them as well. From physical threats and from the threats that words can hold.
riverotter,"I personally just like Otters. The inspiration is somewhat from the Buizel-Pokemon, but I've completely abandoned interest and moved on. I sometimes view myself as Sona-less."
othercanine,"Personal connection what identifies with me and the person I strive to become

"
raven,see here: www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/the-magpie-developer.html
deer,I identify with it because it matches my personality the way they act. Also the body type is similar. All of these if it were anthromorphic.
skunk,"I found a correlation between a skunk's living habits and my own personal habits. They have no noticable cry/howl, and I really don't voice my opinions. They are a type of animal that stay away from most other animals, and it reflects my social fears of being put down and insulted. "

dinosaur,"I've switched between animals a few times, but dinosaur just felt right. Haven't switched since."
wolf,Spiritual connection-therian/otherkin
arcticfox,Always been in love with the way wolves never leave each other behind and used teamwork. Loved arctic foxes since I can remember
brownbear,"Brown Bears because they're relatively solitary, not overly social. Wolves because they just look all noble and deep and stuff (even though they actually aren't). Huskies because they're fluffy and cuddly and like to sing.
I stopped strongly identifying with Bears around age 17 as I became more social, but still identify slightly as I do need my alone time to recharge."
bat,"there not many bat furs they can fly, night time , glowing eyes great hirghtins and are for the most part outcasts like i am"
dragon,I always liked dragons
riverotter,"The American Bison is my fursona , but is also spiritually significant to me within my tribe's community.  Bald Eagle is the manitou of my father and, thus for me, in our tribe, as well.  Many other animals I chose are helpers to me within spiritual activities with my elders and myself."
othermustelid,"The natural curiosity, and the attraction to random shinies."
domesticcat,"I have identified with cats my entire life, when i was a kid i would follow around our pet on all fours and pretend to be one.
As i got older i started to admire how they seem aloof but would also come to lay on my lap when i was sad, or how they can be extremely protective and arent afraid to fight.
I also started to admire how they look, incredibly sleek and streamlined, almost like a sports car."
dragon,"Simply liked since a child, which evolved as I aged."
horse,Behavior

riverotter,i love otters a lot and their [general] personality i find parts of mine in
wolf,I have 2 fursona's. One is a wolf and one is a fox. No hybrid. I like both animals equally and right now my wolf sona is used more than my fox because my fox sona is still under development.
dragon,"I admire the dragon's traits of majesty, courage and strength. I also yearn for it's ability to fly, which gives it so much freedom"
redfox,One does not choose what they are--they simple are.
coyote,"They are independent, loyal and "
otherfeline,"I identify as Sholan-a feline like alien species from the Sholan Alliance series.  That species feels right for me, and the planet's society makes sense, and is how people should treat and act towards each other.  So I feel that I am one of those aliens, just without the fur."
wolf,"Maned wolf! They're just very... Unusual, and i dig how they look. According to a couple websites, theyre also very representative of certain qualities i have."
greyfox,"The Gray Fox is the species of fox that resides in my region. I have always admired their abilities to climb, hunt, and their beautiful coloration."
wolf,"Yes, too long to write here though."
wolf,No.
wolf,"I find wolves really cool, i feel more alive when i howl (well, attempt to howl), i love meat (mainly raw/rare beef)."

riverotter,cause i like those as my forms x3
wolf,Bc it's awesome 
redfox,"The reason why I identify myself with the fox is because, I was a reserved person, and I wasn't much of a talker. I came to the fandom in a way to have a sense of belonging when I was in a Domestic Violence situation, and in a way it helped me to survive. The fox has many traits that I once had to have for my survival. 1. Stealth, 2. a strong mind, 3. a balanced and strong heart."
othermustelid,"Based off a Pokemon, just have a strong affinity towards it."
griffin,Otherkin/interest
germanshepherd,"Yes,I generally base a particular animal with a personality trait that suits it that I find fits a piece of how I would describe myself."
othercanine,"Quick wit and trickery of a fox, coldness of a wolf."
skunk,I like how big and fluffy there tails are I like there smell my personality matches them and I like there fur
squirrel,"Long story short, old nickname, enjoyed being a small kid and climbing and the idea of gliding to everywhere so I'm mostly flying squirrel, though I also love swimming and the idea of echolocation, thus dolphin/bat and lastly I'd love to be able to jump high and land safely(rabbit/roo).  "
wolf,I have always identified with wolves and as a wolf therian I felt it was natural my fursona would also be a wolf.
bat,"It is what i see myself as. A mixture of bear, bat, and dragon"
polarbear,"I generally try and have a big personality, as well as cuddly and caring. Bear sums that up well."
arcticfox,"When I first discovered the furry fandom it was on a personal artists website by the name of Frank something. But I time I thought a fursona meant we had to think of a furry character we would want as our ideal mate, in which I chose an arctic fox from that artist's work. Over time I have grown, changed, and have come to really appreciate all candids, though that might be because dogs have helped me conquer my social anxiety. Also their sleek body and flowing movement really goes with my tall lieth frame and body language. "
domesticcat,I like cats.
arcticfox,"Not a clue, just feels right for some reason."
wolf,Loved wolves since I was 7 and acted like one ( and think I am one ) before I knew about the fandom
domesticcat,Cats are cute and cool yo.
dragon,"I have always been fascinated by Dragons, and see traits in them with myself."
husky,Always had the feeling of being partly canine. After looking up typical traits for different breeds decided that a husky would be the best fit for me.
raven,Yes.
othercanine,"Maned wolves visually pull in traits from both wolves and foxes. In terms of personality though they aren't as pack centric as wolves, which I feel applies more to me."
otherdog,I found it to be most appealing to me.
wolf,"I like the concept of ""lone wolf"".  I think it really pertains to my personality.  I also like how wolves are frequently portrayed: noble, strong, brave.  Besides that, though, I just like wolves.  I feel like a wolf most often as well.  I do identify myself with other animals' traits frequently, but the wolf is most resilient, I think."
kitsune,"i identify with wolfs, foxes and dogs for qualities like loyalty,  a pack of friends of family. their physical  looks."
otherfeline,"I identify myself as two: Margay (feline) and Black panther, there was originally a more spiritual connection to them, but it's less important thesedays.

The third 'main' fursona is a representation of how I would physically look like as an animal/anthro, she is a cat. Created cause others did not accept that I see myself as two."
otherfox,nope
dragon,Like dragons and panthers
redfox,Traditionally assumed characteristics of the fox match my personality.
deer,"I'm a hybrid of a wolfpup/microdeer, as I have characteristics of chaotic, but playful aggression, and at other times, I'm slightly silly and clumsy.  "
othercanine,"The animals I chose I find interesting or a part of my life. Like, used to have a German shepherd I really loved and a domestic cat that I also love."
wolf,"After studying through several animals systematically, by choosing a personality trait in myself and seeing what animals best display those traits; i have come to strongly identify with wolves and wolf communities.

"

redfox,"it has my personality
"
wolf,"Mostly for the aesthetic aspect, but I like the very knowledgeable characteristics of wolves and dragons"
redfox,"I haven't had a favorite animal before, but when I began wanting my own fursona I did some deep thinking. Which animal should I be? A rabbit was the first, but after a while I changed it to a fox. Permanently to a fox. Since then, the fox has been my favorite animal."

wolf,"this is the way i feel i am inside, a hunter, a killer. alone"

jackal,A combination of aesthetic appeal and the personality traits associated with said animal in folklore and pop culture.
otherungulate,I have always loved horses/zebras 0.0
snowleopard,"The reason i chose feline, snow leopard is because there is not that many in the fandom unlike say the wolf or fox, their natural exotic looks, and my love of snow and winter, so i chose the snow leopard to stand out a little."
germanshepherd,Theres alot really. To much to put into words
rabbit,"My personality, and love for bunnies.  I am very timid and shy, and tend to be submissive.  Also very caring person."
rat,"The behavior and demeanor fits my own, and I like the way they look.  If I had to live a life as an animal, I would find life as a rat the most preferable to human life."
wolf,I know this does seem repetitive but all I can say is look at actual wolf habitat. It's all about family and working equally as a working society and following one leader rather than having to be either a left wing or a right wing. To me that's equality and therefor that's how I feel seeing myself as that. 
kitsune,"It's my soul animal, and I've always been into Kitsune"
otherfeline,"It seems to suit me, like we are one and the same.
"
wolf,"I'm attracted to anthropomorphic cartoon canines, primarily wolves"

horse,"It is a highly sexual creature, both in terms of genital dimensions and in the libertine way they mate among their herd.  They are beautiful and muscular, and have been symbols of masculinity and sexuality for centuries.  "
wolf,"Not really, I just associate a lot of my personality traits with a wolf's behavioral patterns."
otherfeline,"abillity to sorta purr naturally
"

wolf,"Spiritual connection, in a way. Native thinking."
otherdog,Yes. I believe I show similar characteristics as to that of a beagle.
arcticfox,Similar traits and relative psychology. 
otherfox,I have a strong connection to whatnot symbolizes
domesticcat,I suspect it is due to the number of cats I have been around growing up. My family has always had at least two and sometimes up to around ten. The few traits that I have that I consider to be non-human are from cats (scent-marking by rubbing against and some of my assorted pleased/irritated noises).
otherfox,"I have the personality of a cat and a dog at the same time. I have extremely high energy while in the woods and love holes, forts that sort of thing. Foxes are also my favorite animals."
husky,just always came natural to me heck i accidentally mew and whimper sometimes
hyaena,"Yes, the first time I saw the Hyena I saw this hunchbacked giggling little lunatic on discovery channel, that fits me very well I think. Also despite it's apperance its actually very strong and in charge of it's life even if other creatures can just shove it aside. They say Hyena is the true boss of the Savannah but you'd never believe it without proof, much of what I do goes unnoticed and people tend to drop chores on me because they know I'll do them well while they go off and have fun. (Not joking missed out on a family vacation because the family needed someone to stay home and by unspoken agreement they unpacked my stuff without asking me and drove off. More than once.)
Thats why I like the Hyena akward but not alone and still laughing even if it's completely unappropriate"
otherfox,"I like the nature of the fox, I concur with most of the habits of the fox."
lizard,"A mental extension and a way of messaging who I am forth, partially in metaphorical means."
tiger,"I do not know, something about saber-tooth tigers really resonates with me. It had stuck in my head since seeing the first Ice Age movie. When I commissioned an image of a saber-tooth tiger anthro, I found myself identifying with the character and adopting it as my fursona."
raptor,Possibly the overall design. The wolf is possibly the only one I feel an emotional connection to
rabbit,I simply have an affinity to bunnies.
germanshepherd,They say it fits me the most. And I like them.
snowleopard,"I love the cold, I love snow, I love being outdoors, I'm OK being alone, and I love cats of all kinds. Although come to think of it, I also like water and swimming, so maybe some tiger too."
tiger,"Fierce protectors, hunters, strong females."
otherdog,"Because I needed a sona, that's about it."
wolf,Past experience/family heritage
horse,Not really!

germanshepherd,They are badasses 
otherbird,"Dragon because they are my Spirit Animal, and Harpies (which I do consider to be Avians) because of their mischievous personalities, and Gryphons because of their loyalty."
germanshepherd,Volunteer for local GSD Rescue as well as other local Animal Rescue shelter since age of 7.
kitsune,"I've always liked foxes. I grew up with cats, and among canids, foxes have many catlike traits. I read a lot about foxes in Japanese folklore at one point, and I feel a certain resonance with folkloric descriptions of clever tricksters."
otherbear,Being a Person of Extremes. Other than that? probably teh fact that i like friendly and nice gameplay even when playing against someone. In other words being a Carebear.
domesticcat,Because I feel connected to them. And people are always saying that I act like one.
otherfeline,"I am a cat person, and jaguars have always been my favorite animal."
wolf,have always felt a connection to Wolves and their lives.
panther,"One, I've always thought these creatures are the intelligent ones of the furry fandom. I love knowledge and the hunt for it. I love the fiercness they give off. Even though I'm shy I can relate that if I'm forced I can defend myself."
greyfox,"I created this ""fursona"" in seventh grade, being into Sonic and StarFox at the time.  The color gray represents my depressing outlook on life at the time. (which I have obviously gotten over).  I consider ""GrayFox"" a true, original symbol of myself."
brownbear,Spiritual.
kangaroo,I like them.
redfox,"Some I admire because of their appearance or they're lifestyle or place in the ecosystem, Others because I think they're sexy. "
kangaroo,"The traits of loyalty, obedience, devotion, unconditional love and selflessness are often attributed to dogs in literature and media - it's a highly commendable description. And the furry fandom allows creative minds to think up their own breeds which would be impossible witness in real biological life."
otherfox,Because that is who I am.
griffin,i love cats and griffons
koala,Koalas are my favorite animal since I was little. So of course I'd identify with something I'm most comfortable with.
rabbit,"Art someone made for me, I find it very special and I hold it to my heart."
otherfox,"I identify with huskies because I LOVE huskies, I always have ever since I was little. Loved the movie Balto, loved any show, cartoon, movie with huskies or wolves, and it wasn't until after I created my fursona and was already a member of the fandom that I realized that I had the energy and bounciness of a husky and people said it fit me. 

Also because if I ever were to be an animal, I'd want to be a husky. Around people, a pet, and constantly having fun and being a curious little derp."
wolf,I identify with Wolves because I am a wolf therian and spiritually/mentally identify as a wolf
wolf,"I always have had a fasincation about wolves, and i think they are a majestic and beautiful creature. "
hyaena,"I am a striped hyena, striped hyenas are fierce, monogamous, have regular lady parts, and aren't dogs! 

"
brownbear,because of my large stocky build and my short temper and my strenght
raccoon,I'm curious and somewhat mysterious like a raccoon
otherfeline,"Always felt an affinity with cats and feel I have 'catty' traits.I used to visit the Caracal at our local zoo and even as a kid I knew she was more special than the other animals, at least to me. I just wanted to jump in there with her and do cat stuff. Giant ears and big paws would be nice too!"
otherfox,As a kid under ten years of age and after reading a book on vermin mammals it just felt right and made me happy.
cheetah,"Yes, one that initially seemed odd yet fitting.  I could never place why, and still have trouble doing so.  But, it fits, and it's me."
riverotter,N/A
horse,"Dragon form was inspired by my Scottish heritage.
Horse form was inspired by well known NSFW artist, Gideon Hoss.
Wolf was grabbed from my love of wild canines.
Gecko (lizard) was inspired by the need to have a form that could fit in a normal space such as a car or a restaurant booth."
wolf,"I feel that there is a trust in their eyes, and trust is the most important aspect of my life."
dragon,"Felt that the commonly (and some not so commonly) accepted behavioral traits of dragons in mythology were similar to my own, i.e generally reclusive, protective, being largely independent etc."
othermustelid,"Long-term interest, knowledge of spirit animals and totems, admiration.  "
raccoon,"Intelligence, creativity, tenacity"
coyote,"Coyote is one of my Medicines, and thus, I have chosen such medicine to represent myself in the fandom. Coyote people make a lot of mistakes, and in order for them to learn, make mistakes over and over again. They also enjoy pulling tricks and pranks on people, as per the personality of Coyote that most people are aware of- the trickster, always losing his battles. A good stories to read would be Navajo Coyote Tales, which teach through Coyote’s constant failures to best all the other animals. Coyote medicine also teaches people to laugh at themselves, and not take yourself too seriously. All of these things I have poured into her being. 


. I follow the Good Red Road- a lifestyle and spirituality that, for me, is rooted in Oglala-Lakota traditions and culture, ceremonies, prayer, and things of that nature- and thus, so does my character."
lion,"The lion represents in human culture strength and courage which I certainly need.  But in a way I feel a true part of my ""soul"" is a lion.  Yet I'm not fully a Therian (or such)."
raven,Crows have spiritual significance. Dog because I do puppy play. Griffin because they're an easy way to combine a bird and a dog.
otherdog,"I chose a Labrador some time ago as my fursona animal due to it's ability to work, it's great with kids, it's sporty, fun, and enjoys others' company."
othermustelid,"The Pine marten is a clever, hardy, and quick creature. Omnivorous, fun, flexible, and athletic."
redfox,I love red foxes and the art I look at including them I find very attractive
squirrel,"Partly that they're small, nimble, and cute, but also that they're primarily woodland critters. It's always been a wish of mine to live in a forest one day."
squirrel,Find them attractive.
dragon,"Furona is an eastern dragon, because I liek the strength and power of dragons, bt the  behavior and mythology behind the eastern drgaon appeals more to me than that of westernd rgaons. "
pandabear,"I'm bear shaped, I have sex about once a decade - panda just seemed obvious!"
wolf,because sometimes i feel like a lone wolf and no one ever supports me in what i do and i feel negected and just hunted for my things and nothing else
snowleopard,"I identify with wolves because since I was young I've always had a deep fascination with wolves. The teamwork, family feeling, the midnight howls, the connectivity and trust they have for each other. The gracefulness of the pack. I just love them and for a very long time acted like I was one. I'd sleep with my dog in her crate, lap water from the same bowl(I was little though, remember this) and believed in my heart that I had been a wolf in my past life. When I came to grow older and found that I had a deep laziness and cat-like nature to me, I couldn't part with who I had once been and made myself a Snolf. I just allowed my fursona to evolve like I had into something better but still the same. :)"
wolf,"It is my spirit animal, as well as a personal liking to the animal (wolf)"
cougar,"It is beautiful, it has characteristics I admire and desire to have as a human.  It is a predator."
redfox,I identify with it because of my personality. 
horse,I like horses.

othermusteloid,"belcause i feel the wolf is part of me and who i am i feel a storng conetion
"
dragon,"Dragons are often said t ospeak in riddles, and I don't often give straight answers for some reason. Wolves are close and social with their family, and I'm the same with what I consider family. Hooves we're just added for aesthetic purposes."
tiger,I love Tigers!
wolf,I've always identified with wolves.
pandabear,"Bears are mostly solitary beast but they often enjoy company, they are big Mammals and full of energy, beautiful creatures"
greyfox,"My dragon character was my first character, and served as a defense mechanism. He was strong both physically and emotionally during my teenage and early adulthood years. As I matured and met my boyfriend, I no longer needed that kind of strength. My fox character came into existence at this point and is now my primary fursona. He more closely resembles my strong will, but is able to be more sympathetic and submissive if I need him to be."
dragon,I'm Dragon otherkin. 
redfox,No other reason than the red fox is by far my favorite animal. 
wolf,It fits me
lion,They are regal and prideful. They protect their kin and defend them at all cost.
riverotter,Because of the personality and bodytype similarities between myself and an otter.
redfox,"I chose a fox because they are often shy with strangers but extreme intelligent and mischievous. They are also single minded. I also associate with the raccoon because the way they treat their food is similar to myself, try are also intelligent, with a knack for puzzles and remembering things. They are well known to become aggressive when they or family are in danger."
pandabear,"I chose the wolf & bat as a hybrid because I have been connected spiritually to wolves all my life & I wanted to make a hybrid that has similar attributes as the wolf & me, so i choose the bat because all 3 of us have common factors, we have bad vision, but great hearing,smell & taste. As for my panda choice, I made him as a second character because I have also had a love of bears & I chose the bear that i believe represents with me most "
dragon,It depends on my mood for what  furry I am.
redfox,Felt a connection between various cartoon depictions of the animal.
wolf,I absolutely love wolves and always have been close to them in a way
cougar,"I wanted a cat that was both large and a great instrumental symbol of my personal intense pride with America. It fit me as I am a somewhat larger man, but not so much so that I am the tallest in the room. I can be both bigger and smaller, a man at ease with physical challenge, and still with enough challenge to make it interesting. I saw cougar as also beneficial as I am all about underused species of cats. This also has shown many benefits with artists as they enjoy how easy it is to color a 4 color animal color markings. "
dragon,"Strong love for the freedom, the mystery, and the power wolves and dragons possess. "
rabbit,"I've always loved foxes and when I found out about japanese fox legends it lead me to the furry fandom. rabbit was selected because it's also part of my fursona
"
redfox,Wolves and foxes are my favorite animal personally.
otherdog,"I always found sharks and canines to be an attractive species(that attractiveness in many aspects [biological, sexual, ect.]. They are likely my favorite animals and I enjoy drawing them as well."
grizzlybear,"The bear is content by itself, and therefore doesn't need to be in a pack whether it chooses to or not. Bears are of strong mind, soul, heart, and doesn't care if it's chubby. They protect those that they love, those that are special and cherished. They are honourable creatures. Plus... they hibernate, which is pretty cool."
collie,I am a Fogolf Fox/Dog/Wolf with blue fur and a brown tail. This has been me since I can remember. He feels part of me.
dragon,"1)  Feline, Lion:  I chose that as my fursona when I was going through a bought of depression, I associated with the historical roles of power and bravery.

2) Reptiloid, Dragon:  Dragons are awesome, also from a mythological standpoint they are very interesting.

3)Bird, Raven/Crow:  My most recent change in fursona, again influenced by another bought of depression.  I came to identify with ravens because of their quirky behavior, using their intellect to create opportunities, something I desperately wanted to be able to do again.  I still identify with ravens even though the depression has passed."
otherfox,"personality wise, it suits me"
raccoon,"Dragon- I love dragons very much,plus see myself as a protector of others,and strongly want to keep them safe and loved.
Raccoon- They represent my more vulnerable side,fluffy and cuddly too,and also deals with my nocturnal nature and love of stealth."

othercanine,My spirit guides 
redfox,Fox character identifies well with me.
snowleopard,"I have always liked the snow leopard, long before I was introduced to furry fandom."
raven,They seem to haver certain behaviour patterns I do
hyaena,"I chose the raccoon, for it's curiosity and tendency to get into things and usually break them. I chose the bear, as it's powerful nature inspires me to be more ambitious. I chose the deer, for it's serenity, the calmness it invokes. I chose the hyena because of it's cackle when it breaths, and I found that trait humorous, that even when it is serious it is still laughing.          "
lion,"Sloth : my laziness and my occasional slowness
Lion : my haircut and my passion loving side (drama, epic stories, romantism, etc)"
domesticcat,"I feel akin to a cat's behaviour and their reactions with others

and just really like cats they're p. great."
domesticcat,"yes, with a cat"

collie,I see myself as having a high amount of energy and the love of being active like a collie.
otherungulate,No. Mooses are cool beans.
wolf,We are much alike
domesticcat,"Cats - a simple aesthetic like for them.
Babirusa - an analogy for my artistic and creative drive."
othercanine,"Dog, because iv been often described by others as having the same mannerisms as a dog and i get along well with them.

As such I relate better to felines."
otherfox,I feel that it spiritually fits me.
wolf,"Always liked wolves since I was very young, liked werewolf stories and art when I was a teenager and feel that I am a bit of a lone wolf in my life, hence the identification with wolves."
domesticcat,It's probably having grown up with 'em.
polarbear,"I find them interesting and in many ways awesome and admirable, because of their biological adaptations to the dire enviroment they live in, as well as their natural beauty and cultural importance."
othercanine,"I discovered that my name means fox, and i just really like fox's, so i based my sona on a fox, but it isnt quite a full fox"
deer,I find myself holding some similar personality traits that are often associated with those animals.
othercanine,"Its (Maned Wolf) behaviour and social interactions, being solitary but monogamous to its mate, is something that I could identify with. Also they're cute :P"

Dragon- idk, it just felt kinda right"
wolf,I believe that the wolf is my spirit guide.  
kitsune,I have a rather 3rd person view of the world and do not care about others  problems also    I enjoy toying ( mostly phycologically) with others and watching their reaction.

grew up with dogs, love dogs, want dogs, it made sense"
mouse,Cultural Reasons
otherfeline,"I feel the personality of others with the character aligns well with my own. I admire the characteristics of the animal - physical looks, hunting style, life style.  I also believe I have some characteristics in common - physical build, geographical region from which family lives"
otherfeline,"Trent Lyon
He is my main sona, i identify as him because he is a Lion-Lynx hybrid and is a male herm, i myself have a feminine and ""manly"" side, therefore i went male herm on FA.
The other two are just for fun :3"
other,"My personality, body-type, favorite animal from childhood. It's what I'd turn into if I were transformed."
arcticfox,"Everything from previous Role Playing characters, to just loving the animal."
tiger,Wolf- main fursona. Shep- Theriotype. Tiger- second fursona. Dragon- OC.
coyote,"In reality, I'm not all that large of a male, so I identify with the Red Wolf (The red wolf is said to have both wolf and coyote blood so that is why I had marked both) because this particular species is smaller and more graceful than that of the Grey Wolf. Mostly though, the wolf has meant a lot to me even long before I even knew about the fandom and I could find myself admiring its intellect, pack mentality, and its art of stealth... also, how can you not love that sharp stare and fluffy coat?"
raccoon,"The reason I identify with the raccoon is due to the inclusion of a character I crafted whose species happened to be the aforementioned animal, which became endeared to me following my character's creation. "
coyote,"Personality is in line with several perceived traits, plus I just like coyotes"
wolf,It's my favorite animal.
wolf,Respect for traits and behaviors.
badger,"My main furry persona is a honey badger, because I'm generally a big grump and I liked the simple color scheme."

wolf,"Yes, I identify with it because i have always loved wolves. I feel as if part of me is a part of them. "
otherdog,"Poodle, as I remind myself of our pet poodle/general poodle-like stereotypes."
domesticcat,"Cat because while I seem lazy, if there's something I'm doing, I'm doing it with all my focus on that thing.  Dragon because of latent greed, and bat because they're nifty."
otherungulate,"Ungulate, Other - Donkey, more specifically. While I really do love horses, I feel that the humble donkey fits my personality more. Donkeys are animals that follow inertia pretty closely - When they're working, they work hard, but when they're not, it's not always easy to get them to start working. They are also more affectionate, intelligent, and curious animals than horses (I'm not quite as majestic as a horse anyway).
They can be downright handsome animals too, if you take proper care of them. So, in short, I love donkeys even more than horses."
kitsune,"Firstly I heavily identified with Red Foxes, mostly because of their personality and I am from England. A few years later, the designs I came up with for my fursona evolved and began to look like a hybrid of a Red Fox and a Maned Wolf. After looking into Maned Wolves a little more closely, I felt it ok to officially incorporate that species into my fursona."

dinosaur,It just clicked into place for some reason.
dragon,"Though I have several characters, the most accurate representation of how I feel inside is my easter dragon + wolf hybrid. The dragon comes in as I am somewhat of a loner and someone that loves the mystic sides of life and its mysteries. Almost everything from eastern Asia attracts me, especially the more traditional aspects, especially the ones from China.

The wolf represents my attempts of not being such a loner, of having a 'family', my own pack, AKA my very tight and select group of people that I would give my life for."
riverotter,"The wolf is totem of mine and I think it fits my personality. It is aloof, yet loyal, it honors the merits of others, giving credit where credit is due. It is intelligent and reserved and yet outgoing with regards to those it loves most.

The Horse is my Chinese astrology sign.

I have also been compared to an otter by others who know me. The playful energy seems to line up with my more puckish traits."
otherfeline,Sloths are just very contented animals that live at their own pace and cats are curious and somewhat demanding creatures.
dragon,I'm a mixture of these creatures in behaviour and enjoy being them as your not typical hybrid of sorts (aka shapeshifter with the blood of those creatures into those forms.)
raccoon,Spiritually Raccoon
dragon,I just like fantasy creatures. Plus I love the design I've come up with and looks very close to my IRL self.
raccoon,"I'm primarily into the overall look, I really like the dark around the eyes and rings on the tail. I also really like there overall work ethic and willingness to accept any challenge placed in front of them to survive."
rat,"The rat, largely because it's my zodiac sign and something I feel incredibly connected to."
hyaena,It just makes sense to me.
wolf,"The way I see myself based on how my family is. (father's side wolves, mother's side collie/mixed)"
skunk,It is consider a pest.. And has an unwanted reputation.  But despite that they an endearing charm and color pattern.
dragon,i specifically identify with predatory winged animals because i really believe in personal freedom. i consider myself very selective with friends but a good friend to those i trust. i consider myself smart as well which is why i associate specifically with the dragon. a recent side of me that has surfaced is my fun loving and cuddly side. this is why my alternate sona is a harpy eagle.
domesticcat,I identify with most of the animals due to shared personality traits or skills and natural instincts I share with them.
wolf,"For the Wolf, it's social traits greatly appeal to me.  Their social nature, protectiveness of the young, survival instincts, etc., are traits that I  identify with."

mouse,"I'm not sure.. I started my first furry character as a mouse, very loosely based off of MouseGuard, after that I started to consider my ""fursona"" of a mouse, though I never created one."
redfox,A lack of understanding with the self; I choose big horn as an identification related to my state.

lion,"I've just always loved the Lion.  it's powerful, strong, and a leader.  These traits I would like to think I could associate to myself."

domesticcat,"Its solitary nature, its tendency to be misunderstood, and its delicate physical characteristics."

dragon,Personality/behavioural traits
lion,Yes there is. ^^
domesticcat,"I have a few red panda fursonas, including my primary and secondary/opposite gender ones. Not that I paid too much attention to their habits and behaviors when selecting them, I do identify with them a bit and love their appearance.

I've also thought of myself like a fox or kitsune at times.

As for the domestic cat, I absolutely love cats and have role-played with/as one before."
otherungulate,"Before I found out about the furry fandom I drew a picture of myself representing my zodiac signs of being born under the sign of the tiger, Taurus, and Willow, as well as being a Nephilim. The combination has evolved of course, and changed from being bull/cow like to being more unicorn like, feline is less identifiable as a tiger, almost seeming to be foxlike sometimes, but the willow part still remains the same in the shape of a very odd looking tail. "
kitsune,Simble of wisdom and intelligence plus their sexy

snowleopard,"Physical characteristics, love of the cold, quiet and usually keeps to ones self,  fairly uncommon in the fandom. Oh. And that long fluffy tail. :3"
greyfox,The only animal that's stuck with me

germanshepherd,"Always wanted a GSD, but never could have one because of the landlord."
kangaroo,"There probably is, but I am unsure of what the reason is."
panther,resonates with my being
otherdog," Canine, Fox, Arctic: Because there is some thing about foxes that i always fond of loving, while i hate being the part of the mainstream, so, red fox is out of question, so there's only one type of fox left, which is the Arctic fox (i don't really like fennec too). And oh, i love white, and also the fluffy-ness of an Arctic fox

Canine, Dog, Other/Nonspecific (specifically: Corgi): because Corgi almost define who i really am, a fun, funny, loving and interesting person, besides, i love the look of Corgis, they have such a cute ear and body (and don't forget their foxy head) "

wolf,Wolves are my favorite animal
othercanine,mainly because of the physical traits.
raptor,Because I'm a relaxed person and I'm highly curious and want to explore the world. That's why bird fits me perfectly.
panther,"My main fursona is a grass-creature spider-monkey hybrid. I identify with monkeys because sometimes they're unpredictable. He has a little bit of crazy in him, but not the typical crazy- the weird, oddball crazy. He's weird, not a ""Pinkie Pie"" or a ""Pinkamenia"", he's my intellectual/weird/geeky side as well as my deeper, more thoughtful and analytical side, more ""aware"" side of what's going on and why. He has odd ideas, believes in different things, and sees the world differently; the fact he's half a plant says I'm for protection of wildlife and forestry, but also for the wellbeing of the planet and the people living in it as a whole. He's the side that people may or may not see in me everyday- we're both so-called ""loners"" in our peer group. 

But he's also the piece that I want people to see, the deeper-side, along with my other pieces (which may or may not include my other fursonas) that make me as a whole."
snowleopard,they're cute
wolf,Wolf is my nickname pre-fandom.
otherreptile,I have 4 characters all are a different side of my personality 
domesticcat,"There's been a large amounts of cats around me my whole life, on the streets, the 2 pet ones I have, in the town. Wild deer are pretty much the biggest animal we have here and I've always admired them. My love for myth drew me towards dragons which lead me to the internet to see artwork on them and in a way were what brought me here and introduced me to the artist and furries that did the artwork, there are like a guild to me in a way."
wolf,"Everyone thinks about the ""lone wolf"" idea, but when I think of it, I think of a wolf pack. Everyone relying on each other to get something done. And there's something else about it that I just can't put my finger on it, but my fursona being a wolf just seems right to me."
arcticfox,"The fox, (specifically the arctic fox) has always been an animal I more or less had fellt represented my personality best. A very cautious animal, agile and a major problem solver in most aspects. Be it helping friends solve issues, or figuring out a way to survive until the next paycheck in the most efficient manner possible, that has been my mindset since I was a kid. To plan, execute, and move to plan B or C if needed."
lion,"Wisdom, power, strength, agility. These attributes have been used to described me by friends and family."
dragon,"Too special a reason and too long to describe.
Pentalis has been in my stories since I was a kid, I admired him, wanted to be like him, then became him. Pentalis and my physical self are two sides of the same coin (the coin, is me), one is myself in the physical world, the other is myself in the canvas of imagination."
grizzlybear,Bears are cute

Its Abilities and Physical aspects are Synonomous with me aswell,My ears are keen hearing sounds others don't recognise or unable to sense just like the fennec's abilities(its oversized ears),my frame is lithe,small,fragile yet agile just as the fennec's,I'm used to and enjoy the heat and last longer than most in it,(i wear hoodies and such and hot weather),and believe i'm synonomous with the regions in which it thrives (North Africa,Mediterranian),the warm sands and sun appeal to me."
cheetah,"I´m hyperactive and can be extremely lazy, I love sleeping in and I love getting back and or foot massages. I tend to actually emit a purring sound when such activities are engaged in intentionally ^^' "
snowleopard,I have several characters that I move between depending on mood and desires as far as roleplay is concerned. The selection of the species was made for various reasons. One was made after I had come up with the name. One was because I knew another person who had a character of that species and I wished to make one. The last was just because I find that species cute.

raccoon,Friends said I was like a raccoon.

it's the animal i identify the most with

I try not to call much attention and i'm somehow clever most of the time

Raccoons -- I've always been more than a little mischievous even from infancy where I would manage to get free of the crib and sneak back in before my parents realized how I got the stuffed animal they took from me back. They're small, scrappy, creative, resourceful and brilliant and if I could be considered with any of these traits I'd be more than flattered."
kangaroo,I have currently two fursonas. The first one is named конфеты кукуруза (candy corn) Who is a black and candy corned coloration kangaroo. I identify with her is the fun artistic part of me that can put my art and stuff i wish to be in her. The second one who is a Welsh pembroke corgi and Kangaroo mix  named Monster Owange.

I keep both because i like both and i think they should be used equally.

mouse,"I took an online quiz of ""What Furry Are You"" and the answer surprised me but made too much sense. Mice can either be cute and adorable or disgusting and horrible depending entirely on the situation. They're also incredibly timid and like to stay inside. Sounds about like me!"
wolf,"I've loved dogs all my life, and my gf love cats, so I've kinda drifted to both sides. And me and her frequently rp and have phone sex, so I chose a hare too. Me and her don't live together, actually separated by 1,000+ miles, but once we're together, I doubt anything is gonna stop us."

Mainly,

Sincerity - not saying things they don't mean, especially the socially acceptable thing. 
In other words, it's the opposite of the what the crowd did in story The Emperor's New Clothes, all thinking themselves into seeing him wearing fabulous clothes.

Sincerity also meaning that they believe what they belive, regardless of whether it's socially acceptable or not. If they believe something's wrong, they won't be budged from beliveing that and acting on that, regardless of pressure or social acceptablity.

I've always loved wolves, they are wild and free. They are strong and loyal to their pack. in many ways it describes me as well. I am more than a bit hyperactive and I dislike being caged in. I work hard to be strong not only for myself, but for my friends so they have someone they can turn to when they need it"

dragon,I've just always liked dragons

husky,The personality and Charicteristics
othercanine,"Well I identify with dragons mostly due to my lifelong obsession with them, but also because of the mythical sense, strength may be attributed to dragons but does that mean they have to be strong?

otherdog,"My primary avatar is a shiba inu (though it used to be a stereotypical fox) because they're my favorite dogs and I think sometimes it would be nice to have ears/paws/a tail/etc.. Normal furry reasons, in my opinion. My secondary avatar, that I use for fun drawings of the sexual nature or when I'm venting, is a pinata because  of the fun colors and ""beating up"" aspect of them (used as a reflection of my life where I just sort of take abuse daily and I've just gotten used to it)."
otherdog,"my lead character is a 'Shiba Akita' because they're very nice doge.
such nice.
much price.

mouse,"I love cats and often follow cat traits such as being laid back, curious and sleepy/lazy (I've been referred to as a cat before). I also love mice and rats"
kitsune,"It's a hard question to answer why foxes, in particular the nine-tails, has become my primary identification as a furry. I've gone though several other species - White Tiger, Arctic Wolf, Leopard, Ocelot and more, at one time or another. But I always return quickly to the Kitsune.

My usual short answer, the one I think of when I think of the nine-tails, is this ""The Kitsune are Magical, Cunning, Practical, & Proud"" from p.155 Hengeyokai Source Book for Werewolf the Apocalypse. Which was my first encounter with the nine-tails back in 2005 before I knew about 'Furry' as a community and that discovery stuck with me.

The longer answer would be, I see Ninetails (and foxes in general for that matter) as being cunning, confident, practical, proud, honourable, moral, intelligent, open minded, and playful - but not maliciously so. The definition of poise & class no matter what roll they fill, from pauper to princess. Liberated in terms of their sexuality, but not ruled by it. They resolve their problems by quickness of mind and body, combined with the application of wit and intellect that allows them to overcome challenges that could not be overcome by more direct means. I hope that by 'taking on' the roll of the Vixen, it would help bring those qualities forward in my own non-furry existence.

Other than my initial discovery of the Ninetails in my Role-playing research, I have a couple of reason for choosing a nine-tails over a regular red vixen. I have a fascination with oriental, in particular Japanese, culture it being strange, exotic, but in certain ways very similar, to my own homeland. I've dabbled with Wicca/Pagan philosophy in combination with Otherkin/Therian ideas. While I've never settled on a established religion or philosophical outlook on life, I do find many tenets in both I agree with. I believe that I do have elements of my soul that are vulpine in nature from past lives, but not all of it. My soul is neither fox nor human, walking between worlds. So a nine-tail 'Spirit Fox' seemed a very apt avatar to represent that belief."
rabbit,"Born Year of the Rabbit in Chinese Zodiac, called ""bunny rabbit"" in middle school for having large teeth."
wolf,Wolves and huskies are great leaders
otherbird,"My fursona is a puffin because I really like the water and aquatic animals, but I also really like birds, so I figured a puffin would be a good combination of the two. I also identify with how entertaining and how much personality they have."
wolf,"I think wolves are beautiful, mysterious animals, and they have always fascinated me."
redfox,"Well, I tend to be relatively silent like a fox normally is (hence the reason the song what does the fox says exists), and normally not standing out, kind of blending in. Also they are my favorite animal"
raccoon," I feel like I resemble a raccoon because we both work well with our paws, are nocturnal (forced to be a day critter though), have a wide variety diet, can adapt to most situations/environments, are clever, curious and somwhat nimble, the list goes on!
"

riverotter,"A strong attraction to the water, a playful, silly attitude, and an appreciation for cuddling."

wolf,"Dinosaur,  and dragon because they don't exist so we can only really imagine what they look and cause their just awesome. "
dragon,Wolf is the reason of being my native animal. Dragon cause i really love dragons. But i think i may just combine the two to make myself a hybrid since those are very rare on coming by :3
otherfeline,"I have too many characters to be very specific, but I feel like I have a very catlike personality. I dislike strangers and highly social situations, and am slow to trust. But I'm sweet and friendly once I get to know you."

lion,I feel I have personality traits in common with these animals.
wolf,The white wolf is my spirit animal and i embrace that fact. Have been since I was 10 years old. I sometimes think and act like a wolf on instinct. I can relate to wolves and the way they act towards each other as a pack. 
tiger,"I believe my soul is one of a once tortured to death tiger. Reincarnated as human due to the nobleness of my past life's actions, waiting for noble release. As a thing, I feel as a white tiger. Defective (prone to strabismus) yet majestic. 

Sorry for the crazy."
tiger,"I feel I Am, and have Always been, a White Tiger."
polarbear,I share the same attributes that it does

wolf,Wolves are neat
riverotter,"Kangaroo, because it was the reason for my given name, and otter because I am a skinny but hairy member of the gay ""bear"" culture."

tiger,"I feel as though I have many characteristics as most felines, and tigers."

I just really like Dragons. They're everything I wish I could be: Strong, proud, protective, brave, confidant. etc."
wolf,Wolf's are most commonly military types
othermusteloid,personality traits in common with the species folklore
coyote,"When I was a kid hunting in the woods alone, I fell asleep against a tree, I awakened with a LARGE coyote standing over me staring into my face. I turned my head, wet myself, and whimpered. It licked my ear then walked away. Greatgranddad says I was spared and chosen. I don't doubt it could have killed me in a heartbeat. I have befriended the local pack who's territory i now live in, but that's another story......."
tiger,None that I can think of. I've been fascinated with tigers since I was little.
kitsune,Something in m nature
wolf,"I respond more closely to the wolf, because of the significance it has had on my life. Ever since I was young, I found out the news that my grandfather was a fan of wolves and not just a normal fan. He had a lot of wolf films, books, memorabilia, he even had a full grown wolf statue in his living room. I enjoyed the company of my grandfather and his love for the animal that I adopted his love for the creature in my life.

However, my grandfather passed when I was 7 and my life became different. My grandmother married a new man too soon after my grandfather's death, and started the downward spiral of the slow and bitter end of my father's family. But through his death, I inherited some of my grandfather's wolf treasures that I wear on my person almost everyday of my life and found the strength of the wolf flow through my soul as one. 

When I found out about the furry fandom, I positively responded as a fellow fan because I knew I had to be one this entire time. Most of my friends get it, most respond positively either because they are furries themselves or see the fandom as I do, and others who know nothing about it still see me as the same silly but nice guy that I've always been. 

As for the dog aspect, I see that side only because I am a loyal person and listen to what people have to say to me.  "
othercanine,"Because I can find a lot in common with a wolf.
I have always loved wolves as well."

redfox,"Foxes are shy but crafty. We hide away a lot and don't meddle with others often, but when we find a friend we're one of the best to have around!"
jackal,"Wolf - I really admire how they're loyal to the pack, they're strong, fearless, and they look cute at times too.

Jackal - I like lucario, and lucario is part jackal. I also like being a bit of a small one in a group."
raccoon,It represents and opposite of me. 
wolf,"Not really sure.  I might identify with wolves because of the whole lone wolf ideal, or it could be something else.  It might be because I just like how they look and this would also go with sergals.  "
wolf,"Yes, the wolf exhibits some traits I see in myself but also has traits that I wish that I had, so it's a nice blend of what I have and what I wish I had, as far as traits go."
snowleopard,Spiritual reasons. The snow leopard is my spirit animal.
domesticcat,Cats and I get along and whenever I nya to them they respond as if we're having a conversation.
otherdog,"I identify with a Belgian Shepherd. Mainly because the species has been so important to so many people, even throughout the history of man. Dogs have been there longer than anything else, not just as work animals, but as companions. 

The Belgian shepherd is a friendly, outgoing breed that is cautious around new things, but as soon as it's comfortable, it's playtime! It knows the difference between work time and play time, and does both as well as it can. "
raptor,"I love them alllll!!!! lol
"
dragon,Because I like lizards and other living beings with scales very much and dragons are the coolest of them.
otherfox,It started as a joke before i was a furry everyone called me fox because of how sneaky i am and because i was really good at figureing things out that others couldnt. So they called me fox becuase they thought i was like one. Later it became my favorite animal so when i became a furry being a fox just seemed natural. I was supprised to find out how many people choose this as their fursona.
snowleopard,Spiritual connection.
wolf,"I have multiple personas but they all identify with me the same. 

Wolf - For my freedom, child-like nature, grace and beauty, the fact I love to play, and am a natural born leader
Dragon - For power, grace, and unique abilities
Bear - Power, Russian-ness, and my sleeping/eating habits"
tiger,"I chose three animals. I feel that each represents a different facet of my personality. My tigress is the fierce warrior who won't put up with anyone's BS. The one who keeps herself hard to keep herself protected.

My fox is the playful, innocent part of me who doesn't quite get all the bad in the world. Sort of my inner child in fox form.

My domestic kitten is also part of that inner child. But slightly more mature and flirtatious. She doesn't think about the consequences of her flirtations. She just  wants to have fun."
wolf,"wolf is just because i think theyre pretty i guess and really like to look at themm,,

deer is (much) stronger for me though! having a deer fursona started as a silly joke with my friends but the more i thought about it the more i noticed that my personality is in some ways like a deer  and like.. idk its probably sill y"
otherfox,"""crazy like a fox"" this is something I was told all the time so I find it to be true. I'm told I am smart and clever. along side all this I love foxes over all so it just seamed normal. I also like how foxes are some times mean, good, or neutral, so I feel the freedom there to be what I see fit was a nice trait of foxes over all. With all that it is nice to have a resin to just do crazy things once i a wile but mostly act cool and collected. "
deer,Not really
redfox,"despite the Grey Wolf being my favorite, i feel the Red Fox would fit my personality better!   ^__^ "
arcticfox,"It feels like a part of who I am, an aspect of my personality."
rabbit,"not really, kinda random"

"

horse,I am also a brony
otherungulate,"Echidnas tend to embody traits that I see in myself, goats tend to embody ""hidden"" facets of my personality or traits that I found interesting/admirable.

Echidna: Quiet, strong, unusual, adaptive, a link to the ancient world, solitary, intelligent, long-lived, unobtrusive, not prolific, prickly, enigmatic

redfox,"Fox: outside assigned animal, easy to work with when comparing/ merging me to make a fursona
Sheep: favorite animal, desire to identify as one"

arcticfox,they are intriguing 
otherdog,I mascot as a dinosaur and a dog character and have allot of fun playing the role..
riverotter,"They are fun and playful critters, and I try to emulate that one characteristic when interacting with others."
otherfeline,"I feel I identify with feline's the most as I'm a very affectionate, and loving individual, but I also have my own agenda's at times, so I'm not always going to show my affectionate side. I can be extremely playful and I love the climb up in high places, even though I am afraid of heights, as well as I am quite easily entertained by the simplest of things like toying with a simple piece of string or something of that simplicity."
riverotter,Aesthetic appeal
otherfeline,I find I'm more similar to cats than any other animal.
snowleopard,i feel most strongly attached to felines and snow leopards i have come to love more than others. for their personalities and their laid back demeanor 
wolf,"Yes, because I love wolves and i identify myself with such a."
dragon,"I identify with these animals due to three things:

a) there is a sense of primal urge that can be described as dominance as those animals are at the apex.
b) there are historical connections that these animals have that interest me, outside of the fandom
c) whenever depicted in furry art, they seem to be very slickly drawn and maybe it's overexposure in the fandom attracts me to identify with these animals"
bat,"It has a certain uniquity to it, and I have often been described as such by friends and family.  I didn't go with a hybrid persona because I don't claim to be entirely original, just genuine."
otherfox,I just seem to be foxlike... loud and annoying.. and fun and cute and silly.
otherfeline,Behavioral traits are similar. Also get along best with foxes and cats. Humans are not required. Yarf yarf.
seaotter,I think they're kinda cute
otherdog,"I'll explain the Rhino. Rhinos look like dinosaurs and they're very big and I've always thought that they look so out-of-place. I'm fat, ugly, and out-of-place, too. So, it fits. "

rabbit,It suits my personality.

wolf,Well my vary fist book had furrys in it and i fit more with my vilin so i took him as my fersona and it fits me
lizard,"It's actually unexplainable for me, but I suppose the best way to put is a ""gut-feeling"" weirdly enough. I'm still trying to decide on a primary one."
otherfox,"When I did research for my furso back in 2010, it seemed that the most ""alike"" animal I found was the fox.
To that moment, I didn't know they were THAT famous in the fandom, but I didn't want to change it as I was happy with my fursona already. "
tiger,"I simply just love those certain tyoes of animald because  they fit my outgoing, sometimes lone, fun, social, and sometimes quiet nature."
wolf,Loyal to friends but independent
otherfox,"Yes, the nature of most species of fox, monogamous, sly, intelligent, crafty, as well as their habits of most kinds appeal to me, if I haven't already exhibited similar behaviors and activities throughout my life. I feel as though I am a fox, which is why I chose to be a fox."
redfox,I like dogs
redfox,traits associated with animal in fable and nature match my personality well. 
wolf,"Actually, the reason I happen to love wolves (and ultimately the reason I'm part of the fandom) is watching the Balto movies as a child. My love for wolves just kind of took off from there."
germanshepherd,The German Shepherd is very loyal and obediant to the people that have gained their love/respect. And so am I
dragon,"The reason I chose a dragon was because they could be anything, and at the time I was extremely self loathing and hated myself, and other humans, and I could make a dragon whatever I wanted, I wasn't limited by the traits of other animals, and then made a part of myself I could start to care about, and build my confidence, and what not. I owe a lot to her, I would not be a professional illustrator without her. "
squirrel,"I can relate to foxes as in what they represent mostly in japanese culture, and i admire them a lot for these traits.

People usually say that i AM a squirrel, always happy, energettic bouncy and fun to talk to...

People also say i'm kinda hyperactive, in a good way."
redfox,"Physical appearance, completely not related to sexuality, instead generally considering it more beautiful than the human being and more reliable in creative works for me."

I adore the markings of a snow Leopard.

wolf,Circumstance
redfox,Just like em
otherfeline,"independent, secret, camouflaged, visually striking, endangered/rare"
othermusteloid,"I'm otherkin? (specifically fictionkin) in the sense that my consciousness tends to feel like it enters other universes completely the vast majority of the time, usually ones where I am not human (not necessarily an animal, often switching between different things, but Quilava is the most stable thing currently). I didn't even like Quilava much until I found myself to be one irl, so I guess I have to say that it feels like it was chosen for me."

wolf,I like white fur and larger animals as well as the vulpine aspect
dragon,Yes
riverotter,"Lizard - Herpetology, particularly in regards to geckos, has held my interest back through grade school and I've since felt a bit of kinship with the cold blooded little buggers. Lazing about, biding their time in the sun, rather stoic looking until you know what you're looking for - they just always seemed more directly interesting than most mammals et cetera.

Otter - I've a somewhat comical obsession/ingrained squeeing reaction to otters whenever so confronted, to the point of self-parody, but I do aspire to the sort of carefree nature that otters tend to be associated with. My general approach to furniture, being often sprawled in the logically least comfortable flail of limbs, has also been likened as rather otterlike."
redfox,It just matches my personality and seems to fit me.
snowleopard,"It's one of my spirit animals. I underwent a vision quest at 16 with my tribe (I'm Caucasian with Native American blood)

The snow leopard was one of five anthromorphic animals that spoke to me for four hours while in a trance. The leader was a wolf but, I've physically met and tamed a snow leopard, from underneath her handlers nose and to the shock of my classmates and instructor while attempting to become a veterinary technician."

otherdog,"I have several characters whom I identify with and would roleplay given the chance. For now, I simply draw them."
redfox,"The fox is skiddish, shy, inquisitive, stealthy playful, romantic/sexuallly driven (mate for life), cunning, mischievous, and they're beautiful animals."
wolf,I identify with both tiger and wolf because I have a lot of attributes of both. My dad seems to act more canine like and in a more packly mannor than my moms side of the family. My cousins fursona is a wolf and my older half-brothers fursona is a white tiger. It just makes sense.
wolf,i believe in the pact mentality
kitsune,"I guess I've just always been a fox, there was never a question in my mind about my fursona. even when I was a kid I knew that I was not a normal human, it just took 10 years to accept myself for being different than the others. now I live to be what I am, a happy mountain fox."
lion,Hair color
redfox,"I admire the perceived traits we have given them, the wolf's loyalty and the cunning of a fox."
redfox,"Fox's are intelligent, resourceful, quick thinking, and cunning. 
These are things I have always been good at, and have kept myself safe with. In addition to my vast admiration of the creature, I also identify with it's traits and feel I share many of them."
jackal,Some behavior patterns seem to align and I've been said to have a mischievous smirk more often than not. 
redfox,fox cause i like them

Admiration for pack-mentality.
Simple and outgoing nature of canine species in general.
The pictire of the 'lone wolf'.
General admiration for the asthetic of a wolf."
wolf,"Because I am a therian. I feel it inside, that all important things that form my personality, my life, are within a deep bond to a wolf, who is living in another world deep inside myself.
My shell looks human, but my spirit is driven by a wolf."
germanshepherd,I'm of partial German ethnicity.
raven,"Wolf and raven just... Click into place, somewhy. 
Guess deep down I would like to be cute  and have a waggy tail, or be a stylized plague doctor.

I like when things click into place. Those make nice foundations for bigger things to be built above them.

Reptilian part is mostly on part of my significant other."
wolf,"None in particular. I think arctic wolves are beautiful animals, that's all."
rabbit,"Several aspects of my personality are very much like those, and my astral self is a hybrid of both of those."
husky,"Well, one part is that i've been very fond to canines ever since i was a little toddler. My favorite dog breed of all-time has been the siberian husky. Also i remember that when i was a little baby, my dad nicknamed me ""lobo"" that means ""wolf"" in spanish. Reason? Unknown. My dad never knew about furry. I grew up thinking i was a wolf and always had the idea that my name was ""wolf"". Then i became a lot more mature and discovered that my real name is definitively not ""wolf"", but i loved that nickname. So when i was a teen, i discovered about furry on the internet. It really got my attention, specially when i saw the siberian husky fursuit from ""Matrices"". Eventually i created my wolf-husky fursona."
otherfox,I find that certain aspects of my personality are like the common conceptions of the animals that I mentioned. 
wolf,Personality
wolf,"I've loved wolves for most of my life. I like the reserved yet strong appearance, like the 'lone wolf' aspect, and also enjoy how they have strong bonds with the pack they're in."
redfox,"Admiring certain traits ascribed to the animal (and seeing some common ones between it and myself), as well as pure aesthetic appreciation."
hyaena,"Fluffy, the mammal dragon, has been a part of my dreams since i was very young and i consider her a fursona and spirit guide. a semi separate entity."
germanshepherd,Always like the breed and am mostly german myself.
dragon,So much in common with it. :)
hyaena,My main one is a wolf/fox/leopard because I'm mischevous like a fox and I just tend to act like a curious little cat online. Wolf just because I love them.
jackal,"I feel that I exhibit the jackal characteristics, the fabled wily and mischievous ways of the jackal, an enigma to understand. There was also this very peculiar daydream I had where in a nutshell, I ended up having a philosophical discussion with my jackal fursona in the Ancient Egypt exhibit of an abandoned museum."
redfox,"Not particularly, no."
snowleopard,I felt really connected to the animal in its behavior and look. It is a beautiful animal.

other,"Appearance, physical qualities"
wolf,I am the leader of my pack I am a empath I feel k9s thoughts 
wolf,"if you met me, you'd understand."
tiger,"There's a connection on a deep level. The first time I saw a tiger in a zoo, my mother nearly had a heart attack because I tried to scramble over the fence to get into the sunken enclosure, and dissuading me from it was difficult. Tigers are generally described as solitary, territorial, possessing a regal air/seen as sophisticated, curious, and situationally fierce. They're also water-loving, playful, and have been observed to share kills with cubs and females (i.e.: seen as a familial provider situationally). Romanticization aside, these qualities and attributes are strong parts of who I am, and the stirring in my chest when I see these creatures can only be described as a desire to belong and as an incredible loneliness. It's a connection I feel strongly enough that all sense of self-preservation gets overridden, and I would put myself in harm's way near a tiger, as has been demonstrated more than once."
otherreptile,"Just like my family, espiacially my grandfather, father and I love cats. I own a cat and I love all cats since I can remember."
otherdog,"Yes, very much so. I am a Utonagan ( A British breed of dog, bred in the 80's to represent all the physical features of a wolf, with none of the feral characteristics. A domesticated wolf in retrospect).
The reason being I have a spiritual affiliation with wolves, however I feel my soul is too tame, placid and social to be a wolf, Therefore I represent my self as the Utonagan due to my social endeavors and Optimistic personality"
otherdog,"Yes, have always felt more comfortable as a dog, as opposed to feeling awkward as a human, not that I have any issues at all with being ( acting? ;) ) human day to day."
othermarsupial,"I have a lot in common with opossums. I'm cowardly, but can fight if necessary. I have a foul attitude. I often 'play dead' or fake being asleep to avoid conflict. I'm skilled in picking up things with my feet. I don't like black pepper. I like to hang upside down. "

otherprimate,I just think they are cool and have raised birds in the past.
arcticfox,"I was born and raised in the northern part of the US I love the cold if it has snow to come with it; otherwise, I really hate the cold. I identify as a fox for my more cunning traits."
otherfeline,"There are many reasons I identify with my Fursona, I can't list them all here but I did extensive studies into the behavior and social aspects of the mix of creatures that I consider myself and they all fit closely with my own behavior."
dragon,No particular reason.
wolf,It describes my personality 
wolf,"not really just that my fursona is a arctic fox/wolf. no idea how but even when i wasn't a furry when i was 8 i wished i was a fox/wolf thing. and i do have some dog like characteristics like rolling on the ground, sleeping curled up, panting when tired (no idea why) "

husky,I feel comfortable with it.
coyote,"Familiar to where I live, and similar common personality."
wolf,Similar personality traits; visual appeal

wolf,Been my nickname for as long as I can remember Alexander Wolf
husky,Depnds on the anatomy of the animal and howtheir characteristics can be appeling through art/pornographic material.
otherfox,"Mostly just because I love foxes, but I heavily admire some of the qualities attributed  to them."
otherbear,"I'm a lazy, hairy grump."

wolf,Its a spiritual thing i fell like the animal of my choice was part of me

wolf,They appeal to aspects of my personality.
wolf,"To me wolves stand for bravery, heart, strength, and they always stay together with their family and friends."
wolf,My INdoan heritage and growing up with a large family I always called the wolf pack cause as a family we work together but there are strong alphas and omegas 
greyfox,"I love foxes because they reflect my inner nature. I like how they are always frisky, playful, curious, eager, happy, and bold. They also seem to have a blissful innocence about them that promotes a positive outlook on their environment. I also like their agile, sneaky ways and how they pounce anything that moves. I like their charming features, soft fur, and bushy tail. They seem to be quite friendly creatures and easy to approach. Overall, I think my personality blends well with that of the fox!"

hyaena,Hyena and wolf
dragon,hyena and wolf
otherdog,I've always been loyal and protective like a dog and always been a dog person. Plus I wanted something Australian so I went with a dingo.
griffin,I like the two species I mixed together. A goulian finch is my favourite bird and a siamese cat my favourite feline.
horse,"The draft horses because they are big and heavy like myself, but they are also strong, beautiful and powerful, just like me. Lions because they are the only communal feline species and they represent how  I interact and relate to groups; Standoffish and reserved, but still playful and loving and all about family. Giraffes because they have always been my favorite wild animal, but also because they are beautiful and tall and unique, just like me."
lion,Identifies with lions and bears due to childhood experiences that stuck with me.

I also love the way that they move, and the way that they enjoy running with the wind.  Physically, I love the way that they smell, and the way that their coats and manes feel.  I also love to get neck hugs and kisses from affectionate horses!  It's pretty cool, how they hug.  Were I to choose one type of anthromorph to be created, I would choose horses.  And were I to become one, I would be an anthromorph horse.  "
arcticfox,I've always loved and adopted both rabbits and foxes. Many things they have in traits I do find in myself in a strong way.

skunk,"Not really. I don't consider I have a Fursona, my Persona is clearly Human, but if I had to choose I guess I'd choose Skunk."

wolf,"I've adored wolves since childhood, and I as a person am similar to wolves in that I'm close to my family in the same manner that a wolf is close to their pack."

I can endure heat like a Fennec fox, just as small,dietry,cunning,swift,fast,hearing(almost),sense of smell,stealth and their very active and jumpy attitudes. I don't like to be captivated (but this is almost every animal?). I like to stay outside i hate the indoors, I'd like to live in the woods or the desert one day just so i can say i went home."
rat,"I have a strong love for Hyenas and rats, so I have a few fursonas, plushies, drawings, ect based on them.
But since about the time I started getting into the fandom, I found my fursona to be a feline. She was the first furry I'd ever drawn, and I just kind of.. I dunno.. I thought she was basically me. Felines have been  my favorite throughout all of my life. She shows traits of a house cat, lynx,  and even ,lion. "
otherdog,I have always liked dogs.
dragon,Born in the year of Dragon. 
husky,"Husky: Playful yet hardworking attitude. Chooses their people wisely and can be very serious and dedicated when the need arises.

Dragon: Sly and sneaky. Protects what is rightfully their/friends. Loves to hide and stay unnoticed but give full attention and love to the people and things that matter. Very intelligent and creative. Spiritually/emotionally and even physically connected to things and can respond very accurately/quickly to almost anything.

Deer: Is very agile and quick to respond. Tuned in to body language and can be very quiet. Loves to stay away from most people and reside in places like a forest of a non-vulnerable area. Is very cautious and CAN be sensitive in a way."
dragon,"me and my character have the same traits, lifestyle choices, and my high school mascot was a dragon, so it kinda grew on me."
redfox,None
raccoon,"Nope,"
otherdog,i like dogs and i have puppy-like tendencies. i also have cat-like tendencies and i used to have a cat fursona.
hyaena,IT just closely resonates with me.
domesticcat,Otter (I'm a swimmer)
tiger,"Before I knew about the fandom I always wondered about felines. I knew if I were an animal that I would be one. My tendency to be catty with others and my ability to make good strategy added in along with physical flexibility and other such characteristics. I knew I would be a tiger when I went to my highschool, the Broken Arrow Tigers. I felt the connection. "
snowleopard,"Solitary, able to live in harsh conditions, tough, graceful, relisiant"
domesticcat,I like cats.
hyaena,"They're dirty, nasty little shits with strong bites.

Pretty much something I can relate to."
redfox,"Because when I was choosing to be a wolf, I was beginning ""Sabrina Online: The Story"" and I didn't want to create any confusion with the existing character Thomas Woolfe.  So I changed my character to a fox.  Love the 3-tone fur and big bushy tail."
other,"My animal is a guinea pig simply because they remind me of me. They're round, chubby looking and love food."
coyote,"The animals resonate with me. Their image, the symbols they represent, mean a lot to me."
rabbit,"With a collie, I feel that I have a more fluffy, loyal, fun outgoing feeling so I connected collies to that feeling.
The deer and the rabbit are the same sona, Derabbit as it is called. I feel that my fluffiness and cuteness connect with the rabbit while my sleek and more serious side connects to the deer."
domesticcat,"For the dragon it's because I've always had a fascination with dragons, ever since I could read I've read literature surrounding dragons and still do to this date.
As for cats is because I know exactly how they act and can form an accurate sona of a cat."
otherdog,"These animals have the closest traits that I have too, making me feel more connected with them."
wolf,"With wolves, you can make them into something epic, with the contrast of colors and with the detail that furs put into them"
mouse,Cow was my first choice when coming up with a fursona but I switched to a snake as it was easier to draw. She morphed into a lizard over time and I often RP as rodent characters and related to them. I use my lizard character Isabel as a stand in for myself or a nameless rodent avatar most of the time as my fursona.
otherfox,Always felt drawn to them.
panther,"I just like the color black, and I like cats."
redfox,"I am a Red Fox Therian. I feel that I am a Red Fox trapped in a human body. Quite obvious, why I'd identify thusly."
panther,Don't really know always like cats and always found panthers in general to be very interesting.
grizzlybear,Well I've always had a love for Bears!
wolf,Not particularly; I just think wolves are very masculine.
dragon,Dragons becasue of their ood balance of Wisdom and strenght... Bovines for sexappeal
wolf,"I was introduced to the fandom by a wolf, Wolves have been my favourite animal for the last 6 years and this gives me a strong connection to wolves."
othercanine,"I just like dogs in general, aliens are neat as well."
griffin,"Gryphons (Griffins) are loyal, and truthful. I like to think I am the same. Plus, I like Eagles and Lions :> "
polarbear,"Unsure, simply more the physical resemblance"
wolf,"I identify with the solitary ways of the tiger as well as the pack nature of the wolf. As I said just one question ago, I am only one third of what makes me a complete person. The more logical part shares mostly the wolf pack nature while the primal shares the solitary ways of the tiger. 

I'm basically split like this;
Mind-Logical-Wolf
Primal-spiritual/soul-tiger
Physical-human"
domesticcat,"Yes, I like those animals and they feel close to me."
kitsune,I'm a changing fox. A kitsune is a nine-tailed fox and 9 has a spiritual meaning for me.
lizard,"Dragons are... at least in my research, pretty fucking bad ass. Immune to most things, physically, mentally, and magically strong. Long lived, and the only stories of dragons dying are either Old, Sick, Young, or insanely out numbered Dragons. That And ever seen watching 'Reign of Fire' I've had an obsession with Dragons. Can't learn enough about them!.

As for the Wolf part.. I mean.. wolfs... I just like them, they're pretty bad ass them selves!"
dragon,I've always admired dragons and I seem to just have an affinity with them. 
greyfox,"I have two aspects of my personality that I wanted highlighted.  First, I consider myself intelligent and very clever, occasionally rather aloof.  Hence the fox persona.  Lately, I've been getting into a lot more fun aspects and have been trying to get that to show more, so I also have a Nimbat fursona for those times."
rat,"Duck is a childhood affiliation, and Rat is something I enjoy"
weasel,No real reason. I chose many. I guess I have time to choose.
horse,"Horse - always been close to horses, am part of the ponyplay community

Snake - favourite animal, represents me well"
snowleopard,"Strongly agree not only the characteristic of having an unknown pattern type is one of many mind games that doubt me, I connect on a mental level with said animal "
riverotter,Got to play with otters once as a kid at an aquarium.
husky,canines that are normally very shy and or aggressive tend to warm up and be fairly mellow around me
wolf,Misunderstood and lonely
husky,"i feel i have the bounce traits and the stuborness of the husky in the way i act, and the way the  huskies i have had and been around act "
horse,"Horse/Deer - Because they spook easily, like myself. I'm usually pretty unsociable and most of the time I'm alright with that because I just don't like people in general. (I'm actually terrified of horses. I love them, but only from afar.)

Weasel(Ferret) - Playful, confident (I've heard they'll attack bears if they feel provoked. I don't know if that's true, however), and lively. I guess this would be me on my best days, when I'm not being stoic, reclusive.. It's not so much that I identify with these traits, rather, I admire them."
dragon,I identify with these animals because they are my fursonas. They are important to me because they are the avenue by which I communicate with other furs.
tiger,I just all was loved tigers  
redpanda,It's just who I am.
cheetah,"I feel cheetahs are my soul animal. They are underdogs, and weak, and their best attribute is running. Sometimes all I feel like doing is just running (psychologically)."
wolf,"Yes. If I really would be an animal that I feel connected to, it would be cat because I've had a cat since I was little. But I feel that there's no way I can be a cat because the furry fandom (to me) consists of much sex and also because sex is important to me. So I have wolf character because I like that they can be in packs and that there's a ranking system. I like being submissive and passive. I love the thought of having sexual activities with canines and I really like how their genitalia looks and works. I'm from a region in Sweden with lots of spruce forests and where there actually are wolves. So having a wolf character is pretty natural to me. I find some people disturbing because of the animals they identify themselves with, for example bird, skunk, goat and other ""unusual"" and ""weird"" animals in real life."
lizard,"Of all the animals I identify with, I have differing reasons for each, though it usually depends on my current mood or what I'm doing at the time"
redfox,It connects to my actualy personality
otherfox,Foxes like it in the ass and hyenas are punk as fuck.
lion,"Main always been a Chimera as always go by mood in some choices so one centered or ""Normal"" So to speak is a chimera like feeling. If had to choose reality I do like lion's am a bit lazy at times like the males and have long hair which gets called a mane a lot so seemed fitting lol.    Being crafty I feel is more for a smaller species and when artistic mood almost feel a bit batty able to see the world upside down so to speak."
redfox,"I feel that I am a fox sometimes and I feel that I am a bird sometimes, all based on looking at their behaviors and comparing to my own."
wolf,Mostly the lone wolf/pack mentality 
snowleopard,"I love cats in general, and those two species specifically. I also feel that their combination of traits fits my personality."
husky,Nope
dragon,"Many characteristics are in common with the selected above. It strongly feels that I'd be such an animal if I were not human, which is why these three fit perfectly. If I HAD to choose one because of looks, it would be a dragon. If I had to choose one based on personality, it'd be a cat first, a wolf following."
coyote,"Not particularly, I like the coloring of coyotes and grey foxes."
redfox,they fit with my attitude and personality well
lion,"Mostly from what people think of me, and from physical likeness."
otherfox,"I chose the fox(other) mostly out of convenience. My fursonna was originally inherited from a friend, and after time passed, it grew on me enough that I eventually accepted it. I accepted it primarily for the personality i put into it, not for it's breed.

I chose the snow leopard because that is the representation I gave myself as I grew into the furry fandom. I felt connected to the life of solitude that the snow leopard leads at the time."
wolf,"I'm loyal to those I consider pack, like the wolf. And I have a patience when dealing with people like a dragon. "
wolf,"Tigers are one of the few felines that enjoy water and swimming. If I had my druthers, I'd never get out of the shower. "
kitsune,"Yes, its alot to do with how i react to my life, and everything i encounter in it."
otherfox,My main fursona is  a coyote because wolves are social while I'm solitary and prefer to make my own innovations.
riverotter,"I enjoy the water. Swimming to boating I like it all. I have fun teasing people, and playing around."
brownbear,"I identify with wolves because if their close pack relationship, something I lacked heavily until recently. I identify with bears because I was almost mauled by one when doing volunteer work in Denali, Alaska, when out of the bus of tourists and my 10 coworkers, she looked at me, and within 20 feet, stared for many seconds. At that time something inside me clicked, and that is when I recognized I was a furry at heart and that the humans have many flaws, but the creatures that live off the land and fight for themselves, the species that truly fight to survive, are nearly perfect. I identify with bears because one identified with me. I identify with deer, elk, moose, and horses because of their grace, simplicity, honor, and the ability to be steadfast even when in the greatest danger."
otherbird,Because the animal is associated with traits that I feel to be important to my personality.
wolf,With the wolf because i have always felt closer to them than others though i'm fine with the neko or domestic cat as well. 
wolf,"Wolves are majestic, proud, strong, and wise creatures, they take care of there own, i am the same with the ones i care for the most. "
dragon,As an otherkin I am closest related to a dragon/draconic beasty.
lion,"Lions are strong, majestic and fierce when protecting their territory. They will even chase smaller creatures for fun and then kill them... that sounds like me. lol"
wolf,"I've always felt some kind of connection with wolves, even way before I knew the fandom exist."
arcticfox,"bat, im an insomniac,
huskey/arctic fox, extremely submissive
wolf, want to be dominant"
collie,most common with my personality
dragon,"Dragons had always fascinated me from an early age and a pivotal time in my life during my parents separation and the time I learned what being gay meant, a dragon-based cartoon was a very strong outlet in my life drawing me towards them more."
polarbear,"Article Fox-primary fursona
Husky-secondary fursona
Panda-lil' bro
polar bear -big bro
brown bear-my favorite plushie :3"
redfox,"The red fox is quick thinking, clever and fast. And from what I've been told by others, I'm all three (Most of the time I agree with them, but sometimes not)"
otherfox,"I'm not sure. I think a lot of the animated films and cartoons I watched when I was young impacted my view on cartoon animal characters. Anyway, foxes are just really awesome!"
dragon,"Yes but not one I could explain with a few lines of text. In a nutshell: It feels like the right thing to me.

Also: I disagree with the identification of dragons as reptiloids."
wolf,It just feels right
dragon,"I currently roleplay as a dragon (if only because I think dragons are cool) But have identified with/been told that my personality fits that of a fox, wolf, canid, avian, and hyena, respectively. So in regards to that, I could easily identify with them as well."
rabbit,"Yes, because they are free animals."
arcticfox,Cause foxes are hot
wolf,"Many reasons, none of which have to do with popularity or looking good... Too many to list."
otherdog,really i havent any reason to it
redfox,Watching the fox and the hound multiple times a day every day as a kid foxes grew on me and ever since they stuck with me so as I grew up I grew more and more attached to foxes. Then I started to collect items with foxes on them or get stuffed animals that were foxes. Now I can't get out of the fox state and i'd even say I have attributes of a fox.
otherfeline,I have always liked cats for their stealth and intelligence and in particular felt a kinship with ocelots.
wolf,It fits my personality and personal beliefs about myself. 
otherdog,It seemed to fit my personality. Loyal and strong.
domesticcat,"I was born a few years before the cartoon ""Garfield"" came out, and when I was younger I was convinced that Jim Davis was following me around using my life as a basis for his comic.
I have always loved cats (even though I am allergic, as any good cat lover is) and have many cat-like traits"
hyaena,"Based on personality, animal preferences, and quirkiness."
deer,It is a combo of my favorite animals and favorite fantasy animal. It's personality includes the attributes of all four creatures that resonate with me as a person.
weasel,They fit my personality.
wolf,"I like the moon, and I like canines better than most other animals. "
riverotter,I like the playfulness of the otter as well as his laid back carefree attitude and it's something i try to be.
otherfox,"Not particularly.  I used to be a fox because they're cute.  But then I realized there were WAY too many.  So I decided to be more unique, and chose half-otter/half-raccoon...Ottercoon."
otherfeline,"My fursona is a bobcat (Lynx rufus) for many reasons. I feel that this species is a good representation of many parts of me, as the species and I have much in common (small but fierce, protective, often overlooked and underestimated, adaptable, etc.). The bobcat is also native to my home, and remains a symbol for my love of nature and animals that I developed growing up there. it is part of who I am, and I don't think any other species would suit me quite as well."
redfox,"I find that the red fox is my species that I identify with due to the fact that I am crafty (I find my way around problems),  I enjoy being alone rather than being with others but when I am with others, I am really good friends with them (which is similar to the social behaviors of a fox), I feel that I am a stealthy person (more so specifically to a hobby that I take part in on online gaming communities on Xbox live), and I also find that the red fox has a visual appeal to it that you can't find in other animals.  From what I heard my personality tends to be different than others and I am the one that sticks out from groups.  From my knowledge, foxes tend to have a wide range of personalities that make them different from other species."
hyaena,I would describe myself to have personality traits of those animals.
collie,"I liked having an Avatar that was both extremely clever and yet fit without a submissive role, such as a canine. Also, there is something adorable about border collies, and I tend to value ""cuteness"" when looking at Fursonas. "
tiger,"Their predators, inteligent, calculated, live in groups, hunt in groups, look greate doing anithing...
"
rabbit,"I've swapped my main fursona several times, but I always find myself keeping rabbit features, be it the ears, tail, or paws hybridized with other species. I suppose it's because rabbits are generally seen as shy, timid, and innocent overall, though they can be mischievous and surprisingly aggressive when cornered. "
wolf,"I've always thought wolves were cool, but there was one problem. I had a fear of canines in general. Since I developed my wolf persona, I've noticed a significant decrease in my fearful behavior of canines, and been more playful with them. And another friend of mine (who introduced me to the furry fandom) has a wolf persona."
arcticfox,the my sonas they protect me
raccoon,Same personality 
wolf,I feel a personal connection. (Therian)
redfox,"I identify with a fox because many of its traits correspond with mine. I'm caring, friendly, and also crafty and sneaky at times."
wolf,It just suits me
wolf,It's my Soul... it's a very spiritual thing ^-^
dragon,the way I act is similar to dragons.
otherdog,"My fursona is a river otter/red panda/snow leopard hybrid. Otters are so playful and sweet. They are also my favorite animal. They are very social and protective of their families, like I try to be. Otters have always reminded me to take it easy sometimes, to play and not always be so serious. Snow leopards are another favorite, and are so strong and fierce. They are one of my favorites. Red panda was mostly for the coloration aspect, but face it, they're adorable. I had selected canine because my alternate is a spunky corgi. Dogs are really great companions, and I can relate to the corgi because of my height and short limbs. "
redfox,Theyer shy an sneaky an adorable
bat,"Yes.  I always chose a species based off of my background, mood, and opinions."
wolf,I choose these cause of my love for the animals I choose.
raccoon,"I am good with my hands, typically silent, and crafty. I am a silent moving person, even when I do not mean to be, and can be a trickster. I am very resourceful and use what i need in giving circumstances. These are very close traits to survival for a Raccoon, other than the coloration, which I was drawn to, I am drawn to their resourcefulness."
redfox,Yes....
leopard,"Yes, some attitudes like being social or not etc."
otherfox,"It's what I chose as my fursona way back when, and I've grown attached to it."
wolf,Wolfs are strong and protect their family and friends 
otherbird,"Not that i can really think of i just like those animals
"
germanshepherd,"they are really for common to me, "
dragon,Because I love it and I do lol
dragon,Dragons are Strong and prideful creatures that have awesome features.
arcticfox,"Im smart, cunning, and a good leader, i also like canines."
otherfeline,"I love big cats and Bagheera from Disney's the jungle book was a huge inspiration for me when I was younger, and the reason I am primarily panther based, though I put my own spin on it and created the Starpanther species. "
otherfox,Not particularly. I just like canines.
otherfeline,"Similar personality traits, likes and a spiritual connection"
germanshepherd,"Not really, to many to identify.  Though i like sharks, being in water if fun. Also deer, most specific the white tail buck. Grew up with a hockey team and the logo was a buck. So just liked bucks ever since. But sharks i loved to read about them and even as a young kid wanted to be one."
tiger,I have always had a love for the White Tiger and that is my spirit guide.
othercanine,"I've grown up surrounded by pets, and I've wrestled and played with them, as well as raised them.
I've shared close bonds with my cats, and my dogs are my family.
Foxes have always been close to me because they share some feline characteristics, yet are canine. It's adorable."
domesticcat,the way they act towards those close to them and those around them.
otherfox,"Not in particular, besides how i feel i can identify with SOME of the stereotypes of the species."
dragon,"First, because I find them the most beautiful between the other animals/fantasies creatures.Second because they are better than the others, like faster/smarter and stuff."
wolf,"Kinda feel better alone, and also can be very protectful and cute when can either be strong and powerful at the same time ^^."
riverotter,"I strongly associate with the stereotypical personality of an otter, playful and cheerful! ^-^"
cougar,"Many of the same ""personality"" traits."
wolf,"When I was younger my grandfather took me to a friend's home where they had a pet deer, he was a buck with large antlers, and I was fascinated with deer ever since. 

I associate with wolves also, but I have yet to make a fursona based on that animal.."
raptor,Nope.
wolf,"I chose Wolf because I see myself as a capable predator and love the outdoors (ie. hunting, fishing, etc).

I also chose Horse because I tend to prefer open spaces where I can see all around me, as opposed to being boxed in. I also would prefer to run away from potential danger, rather than confront it."
domesticcat,Cute
redfox,"I initially chose Red Fox, because I thought myself as being clever and intelligent but also very shy and cautious. Later on, I made a Sergal to represent my warrior skills and traits."
panther,"The canines I chose are all fierce, loyal and beautiful. 
The felines I choose are also fierce and strong, and beautiful as well."
otherfox,Sort of.
husky,"I have been fond of horses and wolves from an early age. My fascination with dragons began when i got a stuffed toy dragon at age 3. My mate and myself have debated over what i am, we decided to make me into a Holf(half horse and half wolf)"
cheetah,Favorite animal 
otherdog,"It's part of my life, and the culture I chose for my own"
otherfeline,"Lynx is my favorite animal, I also feel that the Lynx fits to my ""furry self""."
kitsune,Yes the kitsune is a mischievous creature who is extremely clever is very fun and is a version of my favorite animal the fox
otherfox,"Yes because it expresses me for who I am and why I am that species, strong, talented and smart"
coyote,"I couldn't find snake, I would choose that because I empathize with what it symbolizes.  My second choice would be the coyote, as it is emblematic of everything great about the west."
wolf,"I think that my personality matches with a wolf, maybe slightly more domesticated, but still not like a dog."
husky,"I'm loyal, playful, and act a lot like huskies sometimes"
othermusteloid,Personality matches my own
wolf,"Favorite animal, pack animal, awesome as fuck

You can't not think wolves are epic"
domesticcat,because i love cats
wolf,"To me a wolf symbolizes emotion, care, honor, and that others come first. You won't find a more loyal friend or leader than a wolf who is always willing to stand up, comfort, and be there for others no matter what. I myself am emotional, protective, care deeply about others, and think that others come first before myself. Honor is also a big part for me, besides that... I've roleplayed a giant ten foot tall wolf (My Fursona)  in superhero MMOs (CoH/CoV and CO) for years now! Except for CoH/CoV as it was shutdown last year in 2012."
wolf,"Some wolves are very misunderstood, quiet but intelligent and strong. Sometimes they are loners and I identify with that. I may be alone sometimes but I am still strong and smart enough to survive."
redfox,"Yes. It's a beautiful, smart, free and wild animal."
cheetah,sim eu ja fui ferido por um dez de então fiquei fascinado por ele 
otherfox,Coffee.
redfox,Because I love foxes x3
husky,"I love and admire wolves, and husky"
deer,"Deer are beautiful animals,even lovlier humans."
raven,They are quite interesting to me and out of all other animals they are the ones that I can best Identify myself
lion,I'm like a bear in many ways. I'm very protective over my loved ones. I try to be as brave as a lion. I also love teddy bears.
dragon,Dragons have been a favorite thing since I was young.
badger,i dunno
husky,i enjoy having something around my neck all the time so i do wear a collar and the reason for the species i enough the way that type of dog looks and the funny sounds it makes.
otherungulate,goats are great C:
rat,Love their habits.
otherfox,no
badger,I love badgers. <3
otherfeline,"Yes; my fursona is a melanistic bobcat.  I chose a bobcat for multiple reasons, one being that it is an animal indigenous to my area. Bobcats are soft, small, and sturdy, and they can be extremely territorial, as I am (small, sturdy, and territorial, that is!). It's an animal I feel that I can identify with most. I chose for it to be melanistic because a) melanistic bobcats actually exist (how cool is that?), and the fact that I dress in black a lot (so it makes sense). "
domesticcat,"Mostly for their diverse nature. I tend to relate certain aspects of my attitude and perception of things in a similar fasion as some of the animals I selected above. Some are just from a furry perspective, fitting for a fursona or a mix/hybrid between one or other."
deer,I have no idea. I just think deer are really pretty. 
domesticcat,"I related to black cats thanks to a character called Salem from one of my favorite childhood T.V. series called ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"". I really liked the character. Black cats appealled even more to me thanks to literature and arts. I start feeling a great connection with black cats and felines in general. I added white marks on my fursona's fur because it made her contrast more with her clothes and because I liked them. I also added green marks on her because green is my favorite color."
otherfox,i love fennecs
othermustelid,"Yes, funloving attitute,and happens to be favorite animals, my attitude very closely matches those of my ferrets"
otherfox,Comfortably a preference. Feels right. More or less attraction to certain species I suppose. 
wolf,"certain character of a lion suit me such as the mane I have bushy hair and beard.
Also I have canine habits such as chewing on things and growling and I like wolves"
otherfeline,Just always seemed the most to my personality and the way i act. 
dragon,Otherkin purposes
snowleopard,"I have a strong connection to felines. Friends have always commented on how cat-like I can act at time (flexibility, laziness, cleanliness, etc.) I also love winter weather and snow, making me feel extra close to the snow leopard. "
cheetah,"because of their speed, i identify that as my goals, when i have something i want to achieve i run faster towards it, but that also makes me fail often getting ""tired"""
wolf,"the wolf's characteristics are the same as mine
"
wolf,My birth designates it
dragon,Dragon... always felt i represented a dragon because of the year of which i was borned.
dragon,"i have loved dragons since i was little, and i tend to protect the things i care about most, like a dragon with its hoard"
wolf,"Wolves have been an animal that i've admired and learned about since i was little. I grew up loving them and the more i studied them, the more i loved them. They are like a childhood hero or something where the appeal has never left. "
redfox,"the fox's solitary, forest dwelling, life embodies everything i seek in life. also because they are seen as creatures of wisdom and tricksters (depending on what mythos you consult)  "
othercanine,"Mitical properties, atributed traits, how cool and / or cute they look"
othercanine,They are common in the fandom
otherfox,I like that animal.
raven,I love cats they are one of my most favorite animals ^.^
redfox,I've always had a strong interest as well as a connection to foxes since childhood.
tiger,Because I felt like so.
grizzlybear,I am really similar to a Bear in many ways.
dragon,"I'm sure there is, but I'm not sure just what those reasons are other than 'I like them."" I feel there are deeper reasons but am unable to identify them."
brownbear,"Childhood nickname, also it fits my personality. Just a mellow bear"
dragon,"reptiloid-- i needed something dragon-like, but not a dragon. plus something nautical. sea serpent seemed like my best option

monkey/other primate-- secondary fursona; primate-like species"
arcticfox,yes because the animals that i check are one of my favorite animals and i admire their kind
otherfox,Clever and witty.
arcticfox,"I have always loved and identified with wolves since I was very young. As for the rest, the fox, the dog, and the cat, I use those to express different extensions of my personality."
hyaena,"I've always felt the spotted hyena is a large part of my life, be it in dreams, art, thought and action, or otherwise."
rat,"Relate strongly to, and I keep them as pets."
husky,Beautiful creatures
otherungulate,"Sumatran Rhinoceros. 
I believe my personality matches one. Their shape is also quite similar to my own - they're not skinny and small, but they can sure pack a punch."
othercanine,"Tiger is my main sona and they are different and rare, like I am."
wolf,"Characteristics and traits that I wanted for my fursona as well as for character design aspects. Also, partially for a spiritual reason. "
griffin,Love the concept of them and because
raptor,"I identify with red tailed hawks and felines on a therian level through mannerisms and psychological states. My previous fursona (now a main character of a comic) was a snow leopard/bengal cat mix. She is also a thought form and largely chose her own identity.

My current fursona is a lioness as that is a nickname I've been given due to my hair and the fact that I am a Tropical Sun Leo."
dragon,"Favorite 'creatures', and their designs are flexible as they are fantasy-based"
redfox,"It is like me, looks and personality wise."
husky,"I can't exactly explain why I identify myself so much with them, I just feel like I belong among them"
rabbit,I adjust my fursona around this species alot :3 I feel it closely resembles me.
othercanine,"I've always related to the personality of canines in general, being a very social person that enjoys the company of others! I've never related to the 'lone wolf' type of person - if I had to choose a species other than the weird dragon/wolf hybrid I decided on, it'd probably be a domestic dog of some kind to match my cheerful and outgoing nature."
skunk,There are some particular traits from these animals I tend to do in real time.
arcticfox,"Yes, not telling."
hyaena,Hyenas are unique creatures and I love them.
wolf,ive just always found wolves to be majestic and awe inspiring. they speak to my soul and i really think they are my spirit animal. i love them!
snowleopard,"They are shy predators, surprisingly gentle, and while seen as majestic, are more than a little silly."
domesticcat,At first I love cats and they way of life. Second I've a lot of typically characteristics of cats. And so I chooses to be a domestic cat. 
tiger,"Wolf is my main one. I've just always felt like a wolf was right. Rabbit is because it's like the opposite of a wolf, which I use for a fursona representing a different aspect of my personality. I also have an affinity for slugs and snails, and that 'sona is another aspect of my personality, though a much less prevalent one. And the tiger, I use for my nega-me. The 'sona who is the opposite of my personality, because I've always liked tigers, as well, it seemed like a good choice."
wolf,I feel most at peace as a Wolf. I have felt tugs towards other fursonas but Wolf has stuck permanently.
grizzlybear,Bearish figure in person. 
coyote,personal reasons that regard my place in life
dragon,"I have a strong sense of pride, and I feel both dragons and Wolves reflect that."
wolf,"because they're cuddly and nice, but also at the same time strong and powerful."
rat,"Traits I admire, think they look cool/interesting, enjoyed art involving them"
wolf,because my personality reflects some aspect of the animal.
otherdog,No .o.
otherfeline,"I've always liked big cats, so upon seeing that it was a social norm amongst furries to use an animal to identify with within the community, I settled on feline, but it's non-specific."
domesticcat,"I have tried many animals, but cats are the only one I feel at home with."
otherfox,It represents me.
othercanine,"My ""fursona"" is a dingo and is so because I think the dingo is one of the most fascinating and unique members of the canidae. They're also incredibly adorable"
othercanine,I just always liked the particular animal (Dingo) and it was native to my country so it seemed to fit well.
otherfeline,"Jaguar. Enjoys hot climates, swimming and socializing. "
wolf,"For as long as I can remember I have felt a very strong connection with wolves, I do feel that it goes back to my roots as a native Canadian c:
And The German Shepherd has just been my favorite dog for a long time,
In a way, I guess you could say, I chose the German Shepherd but the Wolf Chose me :3"
wolf,"No idea to be honest, it just kind of happened."
redfox,"My main fursona is a fox.  Her body type (when feral) is that of a red fox.  Although her colors and tail length are unnatural. 
I've always loved foxes, they are mischievous, cheeky and sly.  However; as I take part in pet play as a cat, she can take the form of such so as to represent this side of myself. "
rabbit,"Personality, appearance"
redpanda,"I really find them an aesthetically Pleasing animal, Adorable, fluffy and strong, they seem to be loyal and know how to have fun!"
domesticcat,"I feel like i'm more like a cheetah than any other of the species. With a need for speed, and tending to submitting in a dispute and preferring to run away unscathed.
I have a wolf fursuit, and cheetah and bird (i commissioned nonspecific artist liberty, builder chose hawk) on commission being constructed, but I don't identify with wolf or avians."
lemur,I like its mannerisms and behaviour are novel and appealing. It's not as generic as others but not so esoteric as to look pretentious.
rat,It just clicked.  Been a ratty for 15+ years now. 
lion,I find similar traits between myself and them 
lion,"Girlfriend is also a lion , kinda joined the community because of her (partly yes and partly no) and it also represented something I could see some ties with."
otherdog,"Dingo, specifically. Dingoes are loners with a bad temper. I spend a lot of time by myself and have a general hatred for most people. I'm pretty sure that fits me."
germanshepherd,Particularly behavioural similarities.
otherfox,"Always loved foxes. Both from documentaries, witnessing them in rural Australia and for a brief time looking after an injured one. Aesthetically pleasing, graceful creatures, interesting attributes that people identify with, folklore attaches to them."
dragon,"Parents nicked name me since I was born, loved it and I guess I never changed my feelings towards dragons."
redfox,"Always loved foxes even before I knew of the Fandom.
My fursuit is a Husky Character, one of my favorite breeds of dog."
wolf,I value loyalty and social justice within a community. 
tiger,"Tigers have always been my favourite animal since I was a child. 
I had a bad experience with dogs as a child, and a german shepherd was the first dog I met and knew for more than 20 minutes that didn't try to bite me."
germanshepherd,"I identify as a GSD primarily because I started being friends with other GSD furries and it sort of 'rubbed off' on me, and then the odd brotherly connections between GSD furries solidified my identity as a GSD."
othermustelid,"I can't see myself as a member of very popular specie (like, wolfs, dogs,foxes..). Marbled polecats are beautiful (which I'm not), different, and little exotic.
I consider myself very different from other humans of my age, so somehow I feel little connection towards these little critters (not in any sexual way..)"
deer,I find them aestheticly pleasing and fun to draw
dragon,"Spyro was my Childhood, so in turn i created my own dragon character from being a fan of the games, it turns into being a part of myself and becoming my fursona"
lion,Because I've loved lions ever since The Lion King
dragon,I see traits of myself in my main fursona and connected with it strongly.
kitsune,"Interested in Japanese culture, can speak Japanese, been told I have fox like tendancies"
otherfeline,i really like lynxes haha
dragon,Wolf; Im usually isolated from anyone but can be found hanging around with friends like a pack. I am protective of said friends and will do just about anything to protect them if they need it.
otherdog,"Playful and affectionate, always around to cheer people up if i can."
kitsune,Foxes r best !!!!!!!!
wolf,"I guess I feel I share some canine traits, more of domesticated dogs in some of my behaviour. I feel like I have my person in which to please them  as well as maybe the way I might hug or be very close to people. Enjoys pats :)"
redfox,"Not really, I just have an interest in foxes, as if I can relate with some of their traits."
rabbit,Rabbits are cute and bouncy. Fucking adorable too.
bat,"Well, they're my favourite animals. I like them a lot. So there isn't really a great deal behind my fursonas."
otherfox,Not really. I just alwayls liked foxes.
dragon,always been a fan of the awesome beasts of legend~
wolf,Loyalty maybe?
riverotter,Not especially. The real animals are cute and the furry characters tend to be sexy.
wolf,Wolf is my argo asshole nature side and the crux is my happy go lucky side. I has a suit for both creatures.
raptor,Nope
arcticfox,"I actually have no idea why, but since finding out I was a furry I've found that I like the nature and appearance of arctic foxes"
tiger,I have an affinity for cats and I would like to believe to have the qualities similar to the tiger.
otherfeline,"Cats are cool. Lynxes are cool. Thus, added together, they must be super cool."
wolf,No
snowleopard,I like the big fluffy tail and coat
otherfox,I think Fennec foxes are adorable :3
rabbit,"Rabbits represent openness, vulnerability, intelligence and courage to me.  And love.  Bunnies are love."
othercanine,"A dingo, because I love dingoes."
wolf,Cause i felt it suited me

husky,"Husky was a gift,
Deer came from a family crest."
dragon,Platypus are awesome and I hoard like a dragon
otherfeline,"Antelope- nice colour scheme, speed, grace, skittishness are like me a little,  and location of animal is where i grew up. wanted a creature with horns on the female for aesthetic reasons
Margay- wild cat that likes trees, long legs, like me! small for a wild cat, again im small and had a cute face. Feline behaviors appeal to me i guess.
"
redfox,Always loved and been around foxes and collies/huskies 
otherfeline,Because I like it.
squirrel,I feel that my personality and spazzing tendencies are very similar to that of a squirrel. I've also been a general fan of the animal for most of my life. They aren't my all time favorite animal though.
panther,Spiritual inclination towards that animal (Totem)
wolf,I see myself more as a wolf as i relate most to it however the shark is more of who i want to be so its who i use.
griffin,"Not really, I created my character to represent myself on the internet."
othermarsupial,"My fursona is a marsupial faun ""hybrid"" with both squirrel and deer qualities in addition to the traditional human/goat mix. Hence the rodent, marsupial and ungulate choices."
dragon,"Dragons have always been in my thoughts, from when I was a small child"
germanshepherd,"No, I just like Dogs :P"
wolf,"Yes because they are apart of me, I create a character and it will reflect a certain side of me that I am then able to express and interact with others. Also the animals interest me, they are amazing and beautiful and bring much inspiration to my works."
lemur,"I just feel a connection to foxes and wolves, they are such beautiful animals.
My fursona is a red fox.
But I also have another character from a story I have written, she is a Mountain lion/lemur."
wolf,"Being a Marine, we're taught how to work as a unit, but also take care of ourselves. It's because of this that I feel I share similar traits to that of the wolf."
othercanine,"My animal is a maned wolf. I switched from a fox in 2008 after seeing one in a zoo for the first time, and being struck by its elegance and beauty. Following a dream sequence in which I encountered a maned wolf, I redesigned my fursona. I do not have a spiritual connection with the animal or my fursona in terms of anything supernatural, rather a secular sort of spiritualism, where I can use my self-created fursona as a vehicle to explore my own inner self. Coincidentally, I do also share a number of traits with maned wolves, such as my tall, lanky appearance and largely solitary lifestyle. These were only realised later and were not contributing factors in my fursona choice, but they did help to reinforce the connection."
hyaena,"laughs a lot, quiet"
dragon,"No reason, I just like dragons"
greyfox,fit my personality 
raptor,"Panther lion eagle hybrid, covers my favorites.
Also having watched lion king too many times to count as a kid made me want to be a large cat of some kind. Years later I found out about the fandom."
domesticcat,"A few reasons - I have preferred cats more than dogs as pets, cats are usually more quieter and strategic. I have been involved with cat rescue. Plus such a feline persona opens up opportunity for fun adult related humor by provoking conversation references to ""pussy"". The cute cat appearance seems to make the ladies more friendly. And didn't you know that the internet is full of cats?"
leopard,"I am dragon theiran so i identify with that
but my personality is more of a shifter so i have many sonas
i have similar qualities to many animals
and change to situation or people im around more dramatically than most
i do associate more with my Red Wolf sona 
wolves being extremely loyal and family orientated :3"
coyote,The trickster aspect of the coyote spirit in mythology suits my personal philosophy. 
rabbit,Redwall hare archetype
wolf,My wolf is my spirit within.
kangaroo,"I really always loved being around kangaroos as a child. As I grew up I retained that love and I also notice many traits in kangaroos that are sort of similar, being lazy all day being one of them. I also think they're stupidly cute :3"
rabbit,"I choose rabbits because they could be considered more delicate, shy or feminine as either male or female.

I have no reason for choosing moths"
tiger,I'm a cool cat.
redfox,.
hyaena,"Multiple reasons, my main fursona is Thyme, a Blue Maned Wolf. Although, they're not wolves, or foxes (although they look like them).

I don't really have a reason for her honestly, besides the idea that it just fits.

The others are side fursona's/fun fursona's. They're either critters I like or have grown up around."
raptor,They have facets that I admire or hold dear.
othercanine,Yes.
husky,"Not really, but it stuck"
cheetah,"A lifelong fascination with fast animals (cheetahs!) and fast vehicles (landspeed and airspeed record vehicles).  Used to also be a physical metaphor for my body at the time - extremely athletic build, minimal body fat."
wolf,I just think wolves are cool.
kitsune,Because of my nationality.
collie,"I had a Border Collie growing up and she was with me for many years until her passing.
Love all dogs, but Border Collies will always be my favourite."
wolf,"Hab, my primary fursona, is a male wolf. He represents my masculinity, strength, sexual dominance, protectiveness and devotion to friends and family. All of which are respective traits to the wolf. I also have a sensitivity to lunar cycles in various ways and am primarily a carnivore as I do not get much energy out of anything other than meat.

Miri, my secondary fursona, is a female red fox. She represents my femininity, playfulness, sexual submissiveness, slyness, sneakiness, and shyness. Again, each are respective traits of the fox."
redfox,Because I feel most like this.
hyaena,"Not really, it just kinda picked me to be honest and suits me well i think into the personality of the animal. "
wolf,"my personality closely matches that of my animals orginal natures. My main one being a Labrador dog. extremely loyal, very playful and freindily, a derp, and protective but kind hearten."
otherdog,"My entire life I just always felt that was who I was, for as long as I can remember"
domesticcat,"I'm slightly lazy and often aloof from people, and cats have a close association with books and knowledge."
otherfox,Suits my personality. 
deer,No not really.
wolf,"I used to want to become a wolf myself when I started identifying as a furry, deeply in awe with its grace and solidarity, but as time goes on and maturity kicks in, I see a wolf as more as a secondary avatar which have nothing to do with who I really am. My primary furry avatar is a river otter, but the wolf is the first animal that I had identified with."
redfox,Foxes are known for their smarts and cleverness. That describes me in the greatest.
dragon,Nothing I can think of.
wolf,i love wolves and i have also adoped 6 wolves and visit them regualy 
cheetah,"I can't really describe it. Lions are my favorite animals so I identify with them. Also, I feel cheetahs are extremely underrated so they should get some love."
rat,I identify with the character because of the personality I have given him but not specifically because he is a Rat
otherfeline,"The lore that unfolds around the Lynx in the norhten contries of europe, is something I can identify with. Some of the traist I find I could have if I chose to up hold them"
tiger,I chose my sona as a symbol of purity and inner conflict. I also am a tiger according to chinese zodiac.
otherfox,"I don't really know why I chose a fox as my sona. I just find them adorable and very skittish, which I suppose I am."
otherreptile,"I identify with reptiles not only because of my high interest in them but because I seem to exhibit characteristics of them. For instance I hate the cold and love the heat, all heat dry or muggy. 

My species is that of an argonian (The Elderscrolls Series) because they've interested me ever since I first played TES: III Morrowind way back in '08. "
greyfox,"for they're affiliation with Japanese mythology, and reputations as tricksters
"
horse,"The animal that I chose above was the Horse, more specifically though, a Clydesdale. The reason that I identify with this animal as my fursona is because it is similar to my own personality and physical traits. "
dragon,"I like the freedom of flying predatory animals, so I identify most with owls, dragons, and gryphons (or hybrids of similar types). Having free rein of the skies and not needing to worry about becoming someone else's dinner sounds pretty fantastic."
dragon,"I have always identified with dragons, even from a young age, and always wanted to be one."
domesticcat,It's what I feel fitting to my own persona. 
husky,I have a strong connection toward canines in general but Huskies are what I have the strongest connection with.
othercanine,I meow a lot so people just think I am a cat! 
wolf,The ability to work as one or as a group
dragon,"They look beautiful and have some characteristics I like (proudness, being easily misunderstood, strength, wisdom)."
wolf,many...
otherfeline,"My Zodiac is a Leo, and I adore cats."
wolf,Always been like that for me.
hyaena,"personal choice is a Shiba Inu based on asthetics and personality.

2 OCs i own are a wolf/husky hybrid and the other a hyena."
jackal,"I identify whit those because I really like them, like I like myself, and these kinds of animals are to me more respectfull them most of people, and it's kind of a artistic thing with those, it's a good represention for me to be a wolf."
snowleopard,It just seems to suit me in both how their personalities are with my own. Its like an affinity.
otherdog,"Well i identify with mixed breed stray dogs,cause i'm considered a mixed breed and an outcast of sorts.Though i highly disagree with the mixed breed part as i'm just a human and human ''inter-national'' and ''inter-racial'' procreation to just seems like human procreation,mainly cause i'm one of the so far very few humans who doesn't consider him self to be of any nationality nor race,but just a human(sadly) from the planet earth."
panther,"Love cats, spirit guide is panther."
bat,I chose those not only because I like them but because they have traits that are similar to me.
wolf,"A wolf is a proud, majestic, loyal, sociable and yet fierce creature like myself."
dragon,I've always liked fantasy settings and dragons in particular.
hyaena,"The hyena is seen by the uninformed as an unintelligent scavenger, when it is a intelligent hunter, a feeling of misinformation I can relate to."
domesticcat,Laziness.
tiger,I've loved tigers since i was a kid
wolf,Not really.  Just drew a character one day and decided that it would become my character.
otherungulate,"I identify with them because im solitary, big and strong like a tiger yet i can be social at times like a ram, i like having dominance over everything. I also love how they look. i mean cmon, a tiger with horns? thats pure badassery"
dragon,"Always admired dragons, even had dreams about them. I'm extremely happy for the Furry Community that produces art of dragons in every shape and form."
otherfox,"I love them. Foxes are like my soul mate. When i get to live alone, i am totally geting a fox."
otherfeline,"Because it represents my clever nature, and how I tend to do stuff to help preserve others and myself"
wolf,Otherkin/Therianthropy
domesticcat,I feel like most of my personality qualities and quirks are extremely similar to those of a typical housecat.
redpanda,"I'm somewhat tall (six feet), but I think I would feel better shorter! (5 feet).....
Small, cute, puffy, strong personality, this is what I want to be and identify myself with. "
wolf,Wolves require social interaction to exist.
domesticcat,"Cats are sleepy a lot but stay awake at night more, likeme. "
otherfox,"Nocturnal, cute, and tiny. Chinchillas are squeaky and hyper, like me, and fennec foxes are super-adorable~"
dragon,"I am not really quite entirely sure why myself, but I shall try to explain why these are just the animals that I am most drawn towards as best as I can.  I have always loved bunnies and how cute they are ever since I could remember, so I feel a strong connection with them, but I do not enjoy explicit furry artwork with them in it; I like for them to remain ""pure"" for me since they have a strong link with my childhood.  For wolfs, I was attracted to them because I have always found the notion of werewolves, beings that could transform between human, furry, and somewhere in between forms, to be very fascinating since I find myself to be a highly multi-faceted person with many different, sometimes conflicting, interests, so being able to keep things separate while having them still be a part of me is a very nice concept for me.  I also just find furry wolves to be hot.  For dogs and cats, I have always loved dog boy and cat boy yaoi, I even have a nekomimi myself for roleplaying Konoe from Lamento (Nitro+Chiral FTW; however, despite my love of KonoexAsato, ClearxAoba is most certainly their best pairing so far), so I just enjoy the cuteness they provide!  For otters, I enjoy swimming, so I guess that drew me in with them.  For Kitsunes, I admire their crafty and intelligent ways, not to mention their predominant presence in manga+anime+games (Ran from Touhou is amazing; Touhou is so difficult on Lunatic though... ;n;), and like with bunnies, I enjoy artwork with them, but not explicit artwork.  Penultimately, for lions, tigers, and leopards, I just find them very hot, not to mention the situation that is sometimes put up with them with ""hunter"" and ""prey"", and with dragons it is the same; I just find them hot.  Finally, I enjoy demon artwork mainly because I find their seductive ways to be very tempting, not to mention the fact that I was introduced to yaoi with a vampire yaoi that I accidentally ran into in the ""similar manga"" list while reading Karin, and from then on I began to realize that I was gay since I found that despite my disgust towards other explicit material, I found gay material to be attractive, so demons and vampire material has always been attractive to me since then.  For furry material, I enjoy both full furry and human figures with animal ears and tails and I enjoy artwork that is touching, cute, or steamy, but I dislike artwork that is just lust for the sake of lust or that is with threesomes, foursomes, orgies, etc."
redfox,When I first got  into the fandom I didnt know that much about foxes and began research. I discoveres they had a blend of qualities between cats and dogs that fit my happy go lucky yet whymsical personality and it stuck.
redfox,"Many of my favorite characters are red foxes, and I admire what the fox embodies in the fandom's imagination; cleverness, wit, and sensuality. "
dragon,I love my treasure witch is my friends. I do tend to get hot headed and shot off
leopard,"I have very catlike reflexes, agility, and balance. My sleek and slender body type and keen sense of night vision, make me particularly aware of at least some feline qualities."
otherfox,"I create my Dragon fursona when I just started being a part of the fandom, as at the time I was ""obsessed"" with anything about dragons. Nowadays, I switch between my dragon fursona and my fox one. I think I could find similarities between myself and the fox, as I am agile, intelligent, and pretty stealthy (at least, I like to consider myself like that)."
wolf,"I have certain characteristics of the different animals/creatures. Also, I have two personalities/personas, one a dragon and the other a fairy."
jackal,"I was going to be a wolf, but saw that everyone else was already a wolf.  So I became a jackal instead."
dragon,Past life. 
hyaena,"It doesn't necessarily mean 'owning a furry persona' of said species, but the identification goes to the behavior and actions of said animals."
otherdog,"Not really, I just like the animal in general and if I had to be one, I'd like to be that one. "
dragon,"Because deep within my heart, there is a part of me that relates to said species"
otherdog,"Canine, Golden Retriever. They are friendly and very kind to all those they meet. But can be overprotective. I relate that their extremely trusting nature and overly loving personality can often lead to them being heartbroken by betrayal and hurting friends."
panther,They are all creatures that can be seen as cute and calm or dangerous and scary. They have many layers like me.
rat,"i have 2 sonas, one being a g shep as when i wanted to find my sona i wanted an animal that had the same characteristics so once going around asking people i researched the characteristics and came up with a German shepherd. the rat character is because i have always found them interesting and similar to my personality "
wolf,"Because i am a wolf, my spirit guide is a wolf"
germanshepherd,"German shepherd- loved dogs most my life always acted and played like one, identified as a shepherd for strong loyalty, care/love, and I simply have always lived the breed

Horse- played and ran a lot pretending to be a horse, would always act out as a horse with others growing up, beautiful amazing animals with loyal hearts, best friends, large but well built, grown up around horses and have known horses all my life.

Deer - I've always admired deer for their hardy nature, will to survive, and their beauty. They are beautiful creatures."
wolf,Yeah. Foxes are seen as submissive and sly. I feel I am both. A wolf is know to be a part of a pack and a fighter for the things it loves. Those are two reasons I chose the animal I did.
bat,"Nocturnal creatures, I prefer the night. Big ears, I love music!"
dragon,"They are adorable, I kinda think I'm a cat sometimes, and also, Dragons are awesome!"
otherfeline,I like fluffy ferocious things! *im a bobcat fox
domesticcat,No.
weasel,Spiritual connection with stoats. 
dragon,The tiger talks to me all the time - I dress as a tiger (ears and tail) weekly in Sydney. The dragon is a familiar watching over me.
tiger,"Taking a totem sense, and though I tend to meditate on the psychology of several species, I can truly only identify with Tiger and Jackal."
wolf,"I love canines, pretty shallow but I don't really treat my fursona as myself so its just kinda there."
otherdog,Get along with dogs pretty well?
dragon,dragons are cool
otherdog,"I have many OC's so I selected mutliple.

I just make what I like, there's no real reason for what I identify with."
husky,Our family had a husky for a pet and I saw a lot of admirable qualities in her and ultimately chose a husky as I felt it best represented my own qualities.
tiger,"Some kind of inner connection to the fursona, like a shamanistic relationship."
otherfox,"I love the familiar structure of fennecs, and admire their ears as i feel it matches my personality as a nurturer and listener. I also have to admit i find them rather adorable and admire that quality as well"
redfox,"No, not really. I just really have found foxes more interesting than other species of animals."
husky,"Most of the animals I choose are animals I have Rped as, however majority of them are because of the usage of the ears, tails, or other limbs of that animal that I use as expersions when talking to others or RPing"
lion,I like lions a lot^^
arcticfox,"I believe that in the aspects of a cat i am very similar in clothing styles, movement and my mannerisms. As a canine i feel that i am loyal, independent and a great friend."
otherfox,"Silver Fox: I chose a fox because I am not particularly bulky or athletic (bear, wolf attribute) and while social (wolf attribute) I tend to do  lot of things alone (fox trait) and don't feel either as obedient or eager to serve as a dog. I like the connection between foxes and wit/intellect. However the main reason I chose this species/subspecies is for some indescribable match between their physical appearance and what I feel my personality is.

Skunks strike me as unappreciated and elegant creatures. People recoil from them, but I find them beautiful."
wolf,"Wolves embody loyalty, strength, and a strong sense of family and community. Foxes show my more playful and naughty side, and show me how to have fun. And the fluidity and grace of the Bengal tiger remind me of the beauty in this world and within myself."
tiger,It feels as that animal is who I am
other,"Personality (meek prey animal --> shy submissive type), aesthetics"
dragon,I have always been interested in dragons and have a great fondness for them.
wolf,I feel myself as both sides of said animals
coyote,"I've always felt a connection to foxes
My father was very coyote like
My mother has a love of ducks
I've always just liked hyenas."
germanshepherd, protective
snowleopard,"Wolf/Snow Leopard: Because i am a loner most the time, these two are almost in common in that aspect"
cheetah,"im persistent like a wolf, quick like a cheetah, crafty like a weasel, dark like a raven, and humorous like a hyena."
dragon,"I love them, I always have loved them. They represent, power, freedom, knowledge. A mix between the human intelligence and the animal instincts. They are fantastic creatures, and they can be as different as one human is from another one, despite their similarities, or races."
otherfeline,i found in his characteristics most of mine and some of th eones that i'll like to have.
dragon,I believe that I am a hybrid of both a dragon and wolf as is shown by my fursona
wolf,"Well, I found the fandom because I loved the thought of having a werewolf lover (naturally, I knew it couldn't happen). I ended up finding a fursona in the wolf as it's loyal, strong, generally everything a father and family man should be. It's the animal I relate with because I, too, am just the same when it comes to those I love."
otherdog,due to the similar traits I seem to share with them
otherfox,my personality
arcticfox,I am a major dog person and feel a deep connection with them.
othercanine,Its who I feel I am
brownbear,The all have traits I feel I have.
wolf,The personality of the animal relates to my personality.
dinosaur,"always have - although I also find many ""monster artist"" characters (fabricated species, like Sergals, Kiakrians and Crux etc...) to be a more direct, less confined and expressive approach to identifying with various animal-like stuff."
othermustelid,i chose it because it was the best match to my personality from a local view
otherfeline,"My main fursona is that of a feline, I myself have always been a cat person. It is hard to explain, but I feel more...natural as a feline. My mate says even when I don't notice it, I do little things that are cat-like so...yeah. My second sona is a Bunny, that side of me is more sexual. I enjoy Vore so I like the idea of my submissive bunny side being eaten. Also, hard to explain in full..I just feel like a bunny sometimes. I'm a very shy person around new things...and I'm insatiable like a rabbit."
skunk,"It's slightly different, yet fitting for me. Realistically, no one entirely cares for me until they get to know who I am."
deer,"I share a host of traits with the animal I identify with, and others consider it a good match for me as an author avatar."
pandabear,"I have always been a Neko, and the 3 listed above were my nekosona's since I was in middle school. The fox and the panda are my favorite animals, and my friends always described me as a mix between the 3. "
wolf,I like being in a group like wolves but i love being alone
otherfeline,"independence, loneliness"
kitsune,"I myself am a prankster, and though I lack in wisdom now am accumulating it every day I live. Those two traits Wisdom and a mischievous streak are some of the biggest defining qualities in most kitsunes."
skunk,I have a strong connection to skunks and I am identified by others as a skunk based on the traditional native american totem animal beliefs.
tiger,nyan the rawr tiggy ? xD that's good enough?
deer,yes but prefer not to share
wolf,"I was a Wolf in my past life, and have one as a spirit guild."
domesticcat,"Most of the reason why I chose a Domestic Cat was cause it was the most commmon animal that I ever saw around the area where I lived. I'm also quite lonely, agile, and over-react when I'm frightened."

Then I watched documentaries on big cats and read scientific fact books about them when I was old enough. My love of cats grew to be a strong feature of my identity. Every year at school on the first day when everyone introduces themselves along with an interesting fact about themselves, mine was always ""My name is --- and I like cats"""

collie,"Dogs have always been my favorite animal, I've always grown up and lived with dogs, along with reading a plethora of dog related books (like dog behavior, training, breeds, etc, etc), owning a huge amount of dog stuffed animals, and the other such. Needless to say, I've always loved dogs. I assume this is the most pragmatic answer to the question, the popularity of dogs has been the result of my fursona, so if I were born somewhere else, would I relate to the most popular pet there? Anyways, the first part was, probably, the most pragmatic answer, but I've always loved how (border) collies are regarded as the most intelligent dog. They're also a very beautiful dog with a large amount of diversity in appearance (I prefer chocolate or chocolate merle), very lush fur, and are quite athletic. Definitely admirable traits."

Again, more problems i'm not willing to deal with unless i'm writting something with a set world or plot."
germanshepherd,"I chose the animals I have characters on, which are mostly canines. I like to RP and make costumes of those animals. My fursona is an Alphyn however, which is part Wolf, Lion, Griffon, Goat, and Dragon."

otherdog,"My name and birthsigns translate as ""Dragon"" I love to hoard knowledge and art, but can be shy about my presence/appearance around others, afraid I may come across as intimidating.
As for the canine, when I want to be friendly, the best breed to teach unmitigated friendliness and loyalty is the labrador. I put aside my any opinions my dragon side may have and open myself up to others, and they trust in me their stories and secrects, something both dog and dragon will take to the grave."

raven,Coyote because I feel It suits my personality in comparison to Old man coyote from Native American mythology. 
husky,"I have a big fond of Snow Leopards, Huskies, and Wolves. I find them very beautiful animals, and very interesting. Sergals, just because they're very interesting, thought they're fictional"

I love these two out of all the animals in the cold climates due to the personality traits commonly matched to them, and find myself with many of the same attributes."
bat,"Bats can ""see"" sound, and I like to visualize things when I listen to music. I also like to eat edible Victorian flowers, fruit, and I sometimes like to experiment with the insect-related cuisine of other countries. Bats are also the only flying mammal that we currently know of, making them a bit of a misfit in the animal kingdom. I also kind of resemble the Egyptian flying fox (hair, facial structure.) My voice is also high and squeaky. Oh, and bats are misunderstood as being ugly and creepy (I can relate) but true friends gravitate towards them for their personalities (even vampire bats must have SOME redeeming qualities.)"

rabbit,"I'm a Jackalope, But I mostly Identify with the rabbit because they are shy timid and withdrawn from world. I spent a good decade of my life tucked away in the woods away from people with family. I've been a loner most of my life. I picked the rabbit because they're also smart and extremely high energy. I have shit tons of energy myself and I ran Cross Country in highschool. They're also very cute. ^^"
otherdog,"[Bull Terrier] To a certain extent, their physique resembles mine, especially facial structure ( if you were to make the obvious canine-human translations), along with their personality and behavioural traits.  The best mirror/represent myself."
arcticfox,"I believe they are adorable foxes, and I like the cold and live in a colder region."
wolf,"The three that I chose are parts of me that I feel closely related to. The loyalty and playfulness of a wolf with it's pack, the songs of joy and love and longing with birds, plus their need to migrate and travel. The cat is most predominate with me, as most aspects that people appreciate about cats can be found in myself. I also selected other because I am not a hybrid, I am a shapeshifter, which is uncommon. This is due to my severe ADD and bipolar disorder, so I feel the traits of a shapeshifter represent that inconsistant part of me. "

raccoon,"Similar ""personality"""
otherfeline,"Secretive and fiercely independent, I feel the lynx positively embodies the traits that make me an awkward human being. The lynx does benefit from human activities, with snowshoe hare (food) populations spiking in freshly logged clearings; I might not like being involved with people, but they are kind of nice to have around! :)"
otherdog,"Big, fluffy and white, so huggable and sweet..."
lion,i love lions
tiger,"Ive always been drawn to felines. I love the way they look and act. Even when I was little I always wondered what would happen if any one of them became sentient. How would their instincts and society would translate to sentience. I was always daydreaming about that even before I knew I was a furry, or what a furry even was. "
dragon,becuase i like dragons
tiger,What ever I identified with at a time period in my life
tiger,Snow leopards because There is always one in my dreams.
rabbit,"Cat: I used to be a cat because I just thought they where adorable.

Bunny: I wanted to be a bunny because I am kind but socially awkward online, plus I don't talk a lot and rabbits don't make any vocal sounds... or not any that I know of.

Horse: I was told by my brother that I was fat tempered like a horse, so I decided to make a horse sona with a bit of my personality.

otherbird,"I have always loved cats, and my first ""fursona"" which was merely a user-ID on the Game Talk forums website for the game Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, was ""Indigo the Cat.""  That name has stuck with me for around 11 years now.  Also, many have said that I ""act like a cat"" sometimes.  As for the birds, I don't feel they receive enough respect, and I have sometimes fantasized about the ability to fly.  I was born in the year of the Earth Dragon, and I somewhat identify with them in that I am eccentric, some have said I am wise, and I tend to do my own thing rather than just blindly follow the crowd."
griffin,One does not simply explain why they love birds.
kitsune,always felt a bit of the trickster and love magical stuff
wolf,I chose the wolf as a fursona because it may be just a fantasy but I wanted to picture myself as a stronger and unique being.
redfox,Drawn to it at a young age. When I grew and learned the general furry view of fox nature I still found it very fitting to myself. 
husky,Husky because I had one and he was my best friend as a chil before he died.

wolf,I work with dogs.... And plan to raise wolves as the are the purest form of canine.
wolf,I have respect for wolves as a species and believe to have a spiritual connection to them in terms of soul
tiger,Very nimble and agile Large dangerous animal that can be nice if tamed correctly but can still turn against you

dragon,I identify with dragons much in the same way that they can be misunderstood and judged prematurlu because of all the typical judgements in the fandom.

redfox,"Cleaver, faithfulness to only one mate like a fox, and I have pride like a lion, the symbol of fidelity."

leopard,Ive always thought they were beautiful and wanted to be one if I could.
hyaena,"I was inspired after reading His Dark Materials where they describe everyone as having a soul animal. I took a number of totem animal quizzes and hyena frequently popped up, and it seemed to fit."
kangaroo,I like cabbage
jackal,Not really. I just like the character anubis or anubis like characters due to it being an anthromorph before I even knew the fandom existed.

raven,no
domesticcat,I have a close affinity for cats and find I relate to them through my personality and habits.
husky,"The loyalty of the dog and its close appearance being shared with a wolf made it a natural choice for my interest. It also came to me in a dream where in upon looking into a lake, the reflection shown was that of a Husky."
hyaena,"I suppose you could say a female hyena is the most unfemenine you can get while still being technically female, which describes me pretty well. I also gravitate more to thing that would be considered grungy or ugly. I just like them. "
redfox,Favoured Animal
wolf,"It matches pretty closely to my personality, and is my second favorite animal."
riverotter,feesh
otherfeline,"I specifically am an ocelot. I identify with a feline because I love tuna and milk, and can see in the dark. I also curl into a ball when sleeping, can move my tailbone, and when saying words that start with a ""y"" sound (like yes) I tend to put an n before it. I can also perfectly imitate a meow. I identify with an ocelot specifically because, other than liking them, they are spotted, and I have a skin disease that causes me to be spotted as well."
otherfeline,I've always had a fondness for cats and am a rabid fan of the Disney Gargoyles and hence my fursona is a Gargoyle Cat. 
domesticcat,"I've always been charmed by felines, and enjoyed the idea of being a domestic, pet cat."
coyote,"Outgoing, scruffy, clever? Something like that."
wolf,"Wolves tend to be free and of a pack, but also tend to strike out on their own I feel like I relate to this animal the most, I don't wanna go into further detail cause I'm pretty lazy right now but I'm also partially related to a horse for being a free spirit~ :3"
dragon,Always loved dragons
dragon,Inthe many hours of meditation i have found my true fursona of my own self reflection

wolf,I like wolves
snowleopard,Those are my favorite animals
germanshepherd,The personality. They are loyal and friendly.
rat,"I owned rats for several years.  I like them because they are extremely sweet and intelligent, if a little shy.  They also have a bit of a belly, which I relate to.  And they have a kind of anti-authority air to them, an aura of rebellion.  I like that.  "
tiger,I chose tiger because its not shy and fearless like i want to be which is why i also chosen the wolf and dragon
wolf,I feel like it suits me.
othercanine,"Just kinda awesome, I guess"
griffin,It just feels right.
polarbear,"I'm a fairly big guy, and I love the cold and snow. "
greyfox,The usual archetype of the fox as a cunning scheming survivalist was appealing. And for a while there was even a den in my back yard. After watching them play and run around my back yard I can tell I made the right choice.
redfox,"Not particularly, she was an early OC of mine and I just adopted her as my fursona after a while. "
dragon,Some people see dragons as an all knowing being. I am pretty smart and i can predict correctly everything that will happen 10 seconds ahead of time. Others see them as solitary destructive princess kidnappers. I seem to be a mish-mash of both. ( Except for the kidnapping part). So basically identify with it because I know a lot about many things and I am solitary and very destructive.
hyaena,They have always been my favorite animal sense the lion king came out. Plus they laugh a lot just like myself in real life.
husky,"Always loved dogs, huskies in particular.  They're beautiful animals."
othercanine,"No, i just think it fits her (fursona's) personality. 
I have others but the canine/other is my main.
She does not however completely represents me."
kitsune,"Foxes appear to be clever, but are actually hyper, kind-of funny animals, and they're adorable!"
tiger,"Yes, as I consider myself non-human, feline."
wolf,The strength and nobleness of the wolf perplexes me and intrigues me. It's strong but with pack mentality leading the goal setting process.
wolf,Spirit Animal
husky,I have always loved wolves and huskys so a wolf husky is who i am.
wolf,I feel right with it. I always loved the wolf and wanted to be one where I could live in the forest away from people's eyes living a life off the land and living a good life.
arcticfox,"They are predators, like myself, and true classic furry species"
wolf,IRL experiences with Wolves
otherfeline,"I admire them, and I share some of the personality quirks of felines."
otherdog,"I've always been a dog person, and I love dogs, which is why I identify with a dog."
wolf,"Bird, Other = bearded vulture/lammergeier

Bearded vultures look very striking, and because I'm SUCH A HIPSTER (/s) I wanted something fairly uncommon as an element in my fursona. My character is basically a werewolf with a the head of a bearded vulture; his arms are combination wing-arms, and he has a feathered tail.

As for the reason why I picked those animals, since that what you're asking here? I don't really have one. I mean, I could make anything up and it would sound valid, but the truth of it is I wanted an interesting character design and I like the way both wolves and vultures look. It has precisely nothing to do with being ""loyal like a wolf"" or ""skulking around like a vulture"" or anything like that. I don't need to ascribe human traits to animals to appreciate them."
raccoon,They are fun yet mischievous. They enjoy stealth and being quiet. Much like myself.
wolf,I love wolfs
otherfox,Foxes are cool.
dragon,Same as Otherkin
wolf,It fits my personality. 
germanshepherd,German Shepherds are badass. And adorable when they're puppies cause they have massive paws and ears. And police dogs. Nuff said.
domesticcat,"I love cats in real life, more so than any other domestic animal. That and I'm generally a pessimistic person whos critical of alot, like most cats seem to be."
otherfeline,"Yes; I have always identified with the feline genus in terms of similarities in traits, appearance, and attitude towards others as well as internalized nature. "
otherfox,I'm very quiet and can sneak away from anyone or any thing and i'm nonviolent unless threatened or cornered.
otherdog,"I love dogs. They are loyal funny and playful, but can become excited easily and be slightly annoying, like me"
domesticcat,"Aesthetics, and in the case of cats, personality. "
otherbird,"Split the good parts of you and add it into many different characters. It makes writing a lot more fun when different side of you interact with each other. Certain animal get a certain part. Ex : Lizard = cute and annoying, Bird = serious and wise.

It also makes toying around much more fun."
otherdog,"I have multiple fursonas that represent just a ""cast,"" each representing a bit of myself and my interests."
dragon,no real reason just like it
lizard,Because they are generally disliked and lowly creatures.
dragon,I like dragons and pretty much always have. 
hyaena,"Hyenas are matriarchal, which is something I agree with, hyenas are also rough and tough, ready to get in the dirt, which is also something I am. I also long their nice brown shades and their spots. Hyenas have very interesting evolutionary past and present. They're also just darn goofy animals, so how can you not love them. "
domesticcat,"I have severalof a cats ccharacteristics, laziness snuggleyness, playing with balls of yarn.... ness... "
wolf,"I've always admired wolves' natural beauty, grace and intelligence."
tiger,"The tiger is a solitary, charitable, water-loving creature. The coyote is small, with a loud voice, an excitable nature, a love of making music, and it survives on its family and human settlements. Both run free and possess great natural beauty."
wolf,"Yes, though I'm not consciously aware of it."
coyote,"I would describe the coyote as my totem animal: I admire its cunning and adaptability. There's maybe a bit of an ""underdog"" attraction as well (with regard to how coyotes are perceived by the public). And I've always been fascinated with the idea of actually *being* a canine of some sort."
wolf,"I am a believer in having a tightly-knit group of people that I place my trust in, as in a pack. I am fiercely loyal to those in my pack and do not tolerate stupidity. "
wolf,I've always loved wolves.
horse,Crows are intelligent and a symbol of cunning and mystery. They're also one of my favorite birds. Cheetahs are so lithe and pretty and interesting to follow on the Discovery Channel/Animal planet. I've always loved horses and they're my favorite animals to ride!
wolf,No.
greyfox,"Habit, at this point."
wolf,"That's hard to explain, it just seemed like it fit.
I remember thinking I was a wolf about 10 years before I knew about the furry fandom."
wolf,Other kin>Therian soul thing. Im a chimera
panther,"I can see other animals and ignore them, but when i see a black jaguar, i always see myself being one."
wolf,I love wolves and always have. Don't even know why.
snowleopard,"The long fluffy tail, the coloring, and the strong associatoon of snow "
wolf,"I enjoy snow sports and like canines, so wolf was my choice"
otherbird,"Sort of, I have always liked wings, and I was a dragon for a while, bur recently switched over to birds because they're actually real, and I've always had an interest in birds, even before I was a furry."
lion,Bc i <3 Lions
domesticcat,"Despite my fursona I feel that if there is any animal I can properly realte to it's a cat, I spend most of my time relaxing, sleeping, or both, and am very reserved when it comes to letting strangers or people I don't trust close to me"
otherdog,because it felt right
otherdog,"I act like a dog a lot, sometimes almost instinctively."
greyfox,It's my favorite animal.

husky,I love husky <3
otherfox,It feels right
wolf,I like werewolves.
collie,They look good.
rat,"Rats are hecka cute, and also generally considered nasty, of which I am both."
wolf,"i strongly identify with canines because all of my life i felt a close kinship with them. they're loyal, strong, but are capable of being sly jokers at times too."
otherdog,"I'm a dog person, but my personality more closely matches that of a cat."
otherfox,"""Fox"" was my nickname among friends for years before even knowing about the furry fandom, and I've had a variety of encounters with coyotes when out in the woods. The personalities they tend to have in works of fiction and mythology (combined resulting in a sneaky and sly yet somewhat foolish trickster) are also an uncanny match for my own."
tiger,i consider myself as a swift cunning creature for some time and i thought being a fox would fit my personality or at least part of it. i also like big cats and the color orange.
lizard,"I am Australian, I naturally have a sense of mateship with other people, looking out for another. I have also been spiritual sometimes and rather idiotic like a dog, I have always enjoyed the rain however, the cold fresh air I love. I used to be ecstatic about water, swimming, beach, but not anymore. I always think of others, try to be good, but before I grew a moral, I used to be a little demon, and I have always known that demon has stuck with me, messing with me."
tiger,"I've always liked tigers, and so when I decided to try to participate in the furry community online I went with that. It stuck ever since then and I can't imagine representing myself online within furry communities as anything esle."
wolf,"I've always loved canines. I cannot really put it in words, but out of all the various types of canines, I love wolves the most. Every single aspect of them amaze me and I find them really adorable. 
My fursona was made by one of my closest friends and he's meant a lot to me. It was her's before, but she for some reason wanted to give him to me. She was really attached to him and it was a great honor to be given him. Whenever I've been sad, she's rp-ed with him and he's comforted me and I tend to just look at drawing of him when I can't sleep or am sad. He's a bunny/wolf mix and that's why I choose bunny as well."
cheetah,My favorite animal
redpanda,No reason other than appearance 
otherfeline,"I exemplify some of the feline traits, especially mannerisms.

To me, personally and specifically, I am a lynx.  It is a very cute wild cat that looks like a larger house cat.  Playful and cute it is often underestimated because upon need it is every bit the wild animal capable of handling it's own.  That is similar to me in many respects."
otherfeline,I love cats
raccoon,"My fursona, a raccoon, is an embodiment of my personality, intellect, behaviors, and portions of my physical appearance.  Many of the traits that define me are shared with a the Procyon Lotor:  I am most active at night, I eat anything, I am mostly solitary with a small group of close friends, I consider myself intelligent, sly, and mischievous, I am very dexterous, and I even have dark circles around my eyes."
wolf,I admire the wolf for its strength and their ability to work together in packs to accomplish their goals of survival in an efficient manner.
redfox,"i find it easy to see my self with fox like trates and behaviors
i relat to foxes
they are my favorit animal "
redfox,It was my favorite animal as a child because of the Fox and the hound Disney movie
monkey,"I see the monkey as a very agile creature, a trait that I admire greatly. When I play video games, I like games that provide me different ways of scaling the environment, whether is be climbing or some other means of mobility. The Assassin's Creed series are some of my favorite games because of this."
jackal,I've always liked Anubis since I was young and now I'm a mortician in training so it kinda fits me. Plus they're cute. But I don't even take it too seriously.
hyaena,I have traits of all these animals.
otherdog,I find them (Dingo) sexually and aesthetically attractive. They're also native to my home country.
redfox,Art.
wolf,"I'm pretty sure there is. A really important reason too, but right now I'm kinda baked so I can't think straight. Sorry. 

Love the website. <3"
wolf,"I personally chose the raccoon for my fursona cause I do have quite a few traits of the raccoon such as curiosity, intelligence, dark around the eyes but my fursona is also part wolf in that I have some of these traits as well such as being a bit solitary and undying loyalty to those I call friends."
jackal,"Primarily chosen due to particular habitual and mythological traits given to the animal. Jackals are typically seen as clever and curious in their behaviors toward others as well as mythologically known as tricksters. I have a large knowledge of West African culture, religion, and history so the ties to Africa plus those similar traits narrowed down my choices from wolves and coyotes."
lizard,"I fell in love with reptiles the moment I was introduced to them as a kid.  As my life went on, I found that I also psychologically identified with them to an extent.  Most of the faults I fight with are related to a reptilian brain, such as the difficulty of accepting certain change."
redfox,The red fox is my favorite animal
cougar,"I see many feline traits in myself, and I kind of have a way with cats, so from there it was just narrowing down the species. At first I wanted to be an African lion, but as much as I like them it just didn't fit. There was still a lion I could be, however, and one that suited me as a feminine-looking man. Mountain lions (cougars) lack the mane of a male African lion, so I'd imagine if one were to introduce himself by only calling himself a ""lion"", he would be mistaken for a female due to his appearance. As for the werewolf part, it's symbolic of my regrettably low level of patience and tolerance for certain things. I don't show my reaction in real life, but I allow my fursona to vent my feelings in my imagination."
otherdog,"I chose several...A lot of things have to do with finding animals cute. I like my personas to be kind of silly and not-serious. Dogs, unicorns, and rabbits are just kind of ridiculous creatures that are fun to draw. My primary bunny character is actually more of a manga/anime-esque bunny boy and less of a literal rabbit, my unicorn character follows a similar theme. I've always been really nerdy for unicorns, I had a long childhood phase of believing I was actually a unicorn cursed to be a human! Haha. Mostly I just like the history, the mythology, fantasy, and going from ""striking majestic creature!"" to ""My little pony~""
one of my ""off"" periods with the furry fandom allowed me to be more comfortable with pursuing my personal fetishes in the BDSM community; not ""being"" a furry made me more willing to admit my interest in pet play, and I began to identify as a dog boy and a pony boy. Most people readily understood how to behave with a dog and thus groked the dog-human pet thing, combined with my desired role as a service submissive, allowed for more doggish personality quirks with my BDSM friends. In that venue, I met my partner, and so the idea that I'm ""really"" a small dog is just a natural part of our relationship, how we fawn over one another, how we joke and communicate. Drawing myself as a cartoon dog just made more and more sense. 
 In this time I also developed another rabbit persona, and independently my partner and I began to identify with domestic rabbits, wiggling our noses and inventing a ""rabbit culture"". We also decided that as vegans, our future pet should be non-carnivorous, so we relate to rabbits on that aspect.
My latest main persona is a bat, mostly because ""bats are cool"", but being a shy, spooky, rarely seen, and often misunderstood individual, I've begun to relate to bats and become involved in raising awareness about bats. I'm also a bit of a goth, and what's more goth than a bat persona?"
kitsune,The typical slyness and mischief-loving nature usually associated with the fox is something that appealed to me. I simply think I resemble one in terms of personality.
wolf,No.
riverotter,My perception of them as similar to myself in ways that I find quite positive
kitsune,They're some of my favourite animals
other,"Because they're adorable, small, cute and cuddly, and shy x3."
snowleopard,It fits me personality wise.
brownbear,"Well, I believe there are some sharings between humans and animals. In fact we're animals, so it's clear for me.
I'm mostly a bear, because my friends (non-furry ones) identify me as one, physically and mentally.

So yeah, I share some traits with bears :)"
wolf,"I have roleplayed online for a very long time now. It is what started my creative writing, and I have been fascinated with wolves since I was a small child. Since before I could RP and before I know what a Furry was. "
husky,Wolfs are so beautiful.
wolf,"I don't like much fur, but scales and slime is great. Reptile Anthros are sexy."
otherfox,"I've always admires foxes for their determination and cleverness. When I write, I often base the personalities of my characters along those of the animals in Native American trickster tales, but they are often more careful in plotting things out."
wolf,Extreme Respect
dragon,I like them
husky,"The personality traits most commonly associated with the selected species reflect my personality traits most accurately.

arcticfox,I find i have the traits of a cat and i enjoy wearing a fox tail.
raccoon,"i am a rather night going person, i like to take small shiny's, pens, paperclips, ect. i am disorganised but anally clean."
dragon,"Dragon Demon = Draemon I have always roleplayed as either a dragon or a demon, and somehow the line between the two dissolved at some point, and I have a very deep dark history for the real me and my characters. Also, my characteristics fit perfectly with dragons or demons."
griffin,It represents escape from certain factors of my life.
othercanine,"I have a love for red pandas, canines, and reptiles. Pretty much all three came together to form my fursona."
lion,It is my theriotype
hyaena,Their looks have always appealed to me in a identifying way. Their also uncommon in the furry fandom which I fond interesting.
wolf,I just think it's cool.

dragon,"I love the dragon so very much, so I chose it as my fursona."

connection to them."

I have something in common with them too."

otherfox,-
snowleopard,No reason
husky,Favorite animal
deer,"I feel that I am more similar to the characteristics of a deer than other animals. I love deer, and I think they're beautiful creatures."
snowleopard,"Funny, there used to be an official ""The Golden Compass"" movie website to promote its debut with a complimentary ""Discover your Deamon"" questionnaire that released in 2007-- I answered the questionnaire, which resulted with a female snow leopard by the name of Olyandra as my ""Daemon.""
From there, I assumed that it suits me.

-

Personally, I consider myself a bit solitary from communication, prefer to wear light-clothing during blizzards, am a bit snarky, and seldom nocturnal.
However, I have a double consciousness in urban areas where I behave more ""like a dog"" : Loyal, comical, daring, innocent, love to swim, and very social.

Note: my personality is subject to change, but how I came to identify with a snow leopard was relative at the time."
kitsune,"Since I was a child, 
I have seen from the picture books, story books, comics or movies.
I like them very."
wolf,"Found myself interested in them anthropomorphised more than other animals, for whatever reason. Could be their uniqueness to the canine species, but I'm not actually sure."

coyote,Under appreciated canines subspecies; foxes and wolves over-saturate the furry community.
husky,Best represents my character \ personality traits \ awesomeness.
kangaroo,"I really enjoy canines as a species, and they're just so cute.
Despite that, I do not feel like I identify solely with canines, as I have a passion for mixed species (hybrids) and dragons."
brownbear,I just feel in adequation with some comportment traits of those animals
redfox,"I choose wolf because I am no coward and have the wolfs ability to fight I will never run from a fight or give in, I choose fox because of quite a few reasons other than my physical appearance I have smart @$$ tendicies as well as my abilities to get what I want through words or just taking it without being noticed also I choose kitsune because of the multiple tails :3"
otherdog,Not really.
wolf,Spiritual & religious reasons. 
deer,"I have always found deer to be a very graceful animal, and anthro art of deers is my favourite. "
rat,My long hours working at computers in dim lighting gives me a feeling of ratishness.
otherdog,"My identity within the furry community is a bit of a muddle right now - being a therian with little to no species dysphoria I see myself as a lynx, minus fur, but my fursona currently is largely out-dated. She was a character that through years, and years of use grew to become something of a fursona as well as a pseudo 'kintype when over those years I couldn't find my own. However, even now that I have one, I feel obligated to maintain my old cat/dog hybrid fursona even though I am identifying with her less and less. She's still extremely meaningful to me, and symbolic of the person I was and how I changed over the years she represented me. A lynx with some albatross features, or a lynx and alternate albatross fursona would be far more accurate nowadays as they are my 'kintypes and I have extremely strong emotional draws to both."
otherfeline,"Simply love for the traits of the animal in question, with personality traits I identify with"
riverotter,"I chose to make my fursona an otter because otters are stereotypically perceived as playful and likable. I also have a love of otters that dates back to before I was a furry, when I was reading Brian Jacques' Redwall novels."
dragon,"Dragons are awesome. Snuff said...

But really, they're a very cool race with lots of lore and power behind them"
riverotter,"Otters are playful, carefree and love water, like me. Foxes are very shy, but can also occasionally be very friendly if you let them get to know you. I feel this reflects me pretty well."
rat,"Rats were singled out to be the cause of the Bubonic Plague, and have gotten a bad reputation ever since. Nowadays, they make excellent pets.

Highschool bullying made me feel singled out, and as we were going over the plague, it just sort of clicked...

It also helps that MTG released the Kamigawa set, and Rat Folk were also singled out as the bad guys at the time."
dragon,"No particular reason, other than I like dragons."
domesticcat,"Always admired cats, and itentified with them. I feel like our triats are similar."
greyfox,"I don't really have a reason, the more I think about it."
greyfox,Otherkin. I tend to say it was chosen for me rather than say that I chose it to represent me.
coyote,Yes
husky,"Domesticated, bit of a mix, outdoorsy type, looks and fluff"
panther,"everybody wants to be a cat
because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at"
redfox,"Personal ideals, mental and physical traits"
bat,"I work nights, feel dark when I changed my fursona, interesting odds with my religion being that bat wings are demon wings"
grizzlybear,"Totemic associations, fursonae, spiritual governors, Socratic identities."
dragon,Personality features and mannerisms.
horse,Horses rock
cheetah,Most beautiful animal in the world. Also all bikers are cheetahs.
wolf,"It's simply how I see myself; always have, though it has evolved/become more detailed over the years."
cougar,"There are many particular reasons why, but many of the common aspects seem best reflected against my personality, as a whole, of this particular species. For example: I find cougars protective; vigilant; graceful; and beautiful creatures with a fair amount of attitude to them. Then again, most felines are this way, by nature. Cougars also tend to reflect on personal choices, such as variation of color and detail."
husky,My character is in honor of a husky I fostered and really connected with
horse,Have always loved horses and been around them since I was a kid.
otherdog,I had a miniature schnauzer when I was a kid.
otherfox,"Since I became a zoophile around age 12, I knew that I particularly liked canines."
greyfox,"I've loved foxes for years, stealthy and clever little creatures.  Several influences from child might have been the Spy Fox series of point and click games, The Fox and The Hound, and most definitely Star Fox, in addition to other things.  "
jackal,There Traits and behavior is like mine. My friends even think or have said so. Im also a spiritual person and that is what I am
redfox,"I have always had a fondness to foxes since I was young, and my fursona is a fox."
wolf,I believe some common behavioral and physical traits of these animals mesh well with myself.
leopard,"O
"
raptor,"I can Identified with both my charters though that's not to say I am ether of them one of my charters. I am merely the artist that bring theme to life though different art forms.

there essentially original character that have there own personality, traits and flaws that differ from my own. they are there own creations and are more then just simple iconic animals with my self in them they are part of me and complete different from me at the same time. I am connected to them as a creator just as any creator will be attached to there work and put things into there work that represent the best and worst quality's within them self's. as staving artist figuratively speaking I am like the scavengers that are connected to the charterers theme self's just like the elements they portray can be interpreted as a part of my self as well.   "
tiger,"i see feline characteristics in myself everyday, a Tiger because its my favorite feline"
dragon,"I come from arctinareas and i feel happy when its cold so i took a snowleopard, wolf, polarbear. Etc. I alos feel like ahunter thats why i chose a few feline"
wolf,I am fierce and I keep my distance.
wolf,"I've just always taken a liking to wolf, possibly due to my for canines."
riverotter,I think my personality matches those animals rather well.
wolf,"wolf is my favorite animal. and balto1 2 and 3 are my favorite movies. thats what
got me in the fandom
"
domesticcat,I have always had a strong indescribable connection to cats. 
dragon,"Freedom, flight, power, intelligence, grace"
domesticcat,It is by far my favorite animal.
hyaena,"I'm foxy, cute, small."
otherdog,I like dogs an a mutt seemed like the perfect choice. Cause most everyone picks a pure breed dog over a mixed/mutt an I've never been very popular so I was always picked last for teams at school or what ever an 9 times out of 10 most people come to find out in the end the mutt was the better choice/better dog. 
wolf,It's my spirit animal and my favorite animal.
redfox,Foxes and Wolfs just have this thing about them that attracts me to them and makes me admire the so deeply.
redfox,"Cute, cuddly, can see myself as that animals atributes"
deer,I like them
seaotter,"Well, I love weasels and otters, and I had one as my fursona until recently. Now, my fursona is a shark, since I really love aquatics and identify with them more than semiaquatics."
rabbit,"Universal allegories, I guess..."
domesticcat,"Independent and disregarding of authority. More interested in itself than others unless they're useful, and likes to sleep alot"
horse,I love cats and foxes a lot. I think I would just be more like a fox or cat.
squirrel,"I connect squirrels with home, since I grew up watching them and loving them. They're creative and playful and really fun to watch. I also like tree-climbing, so there's that."
raccoon,"yes, I'm kinda of a little trouble maker and i would always manage to sneak into class after the tardy bell rang without the teacher noticing me."
raven,"Birds, mostly, because I've always liked them? I dunno. :P"
wolf,My favorite animal.
wolf,Wolves are my favorite animal.
lion,"Since when I was a child I liked felids, specially lions, and my interest in them grew stronger as I got older. Right now I like to perceive  lions as a symbol of what I'm not and admire, lions have an incredible ammount of symbolism that was aggregrated among time, be it cultural or more approximated to the religious/spiritual.

Even though my main fursona is a lion, I also like to express myself as a Cheetah, which is simply a representation of what I believe I am."
otherbird,"I always loved the notion of being able to fly and sing, two things I really can't do. Also birds have always been really pretty to me and I like watching them sometimes... as weird as that might sound"
otherdog,I am small and quiet as well as anxious and nervous like mice tend to be.
skunk,Early childhood interest in skunks/Pepe Le Pew
dragon,"Dragons are, physically, beautiful creatures, and I feel like their perceived personality is most in-tuned with my actual personality.





And I think they're sexy."
domesticcat,I like cats.
wolf,Meditative introspection
redfox,Yes
wolf,No
otherdog,"I primarily identify with a kangaroo rat, because I am shy, tending to hide away from the world; I often feel small; I am quiet if I don't know you; and appearance-wise, I love the cute package of the kangaroo rat--long tail ending in a floof, bouncy, large, awkward feet, sensitive senses.

My secondary fursona is a corgi. She represents more of the side of me only people who know me see. She's artsy, talkative, and playful, as well as a bit dorky.

My more recent fursona hasn't been fully developed, but is a reptilian. I love snakes, dinosaurs, dragons. I have a few snakes as pets, and in the future, hope to start a small business in exotic pets such as those."
grizzlybear,Wolf. I've had a high interest in werewolves from a very early age
otherfox,"My fursona, a 7-tailed Kitsune/demon hybrid, is important to me because I feel a strong connection to both beings. Sometimes I feel bound by the physical; I'm more attracted to fantasy worlds of spirits, dragons, and magic. That is part of the reason why my fursona is a mythical one. The short story behind my fursona is that she was a pure Kitsune once, and during a struggle with a demon the two merged into one, thus becoming who she is today. This reflects a real struggle I went through, and is why my fursona is deeply personal and important to me."
squirrel,"No, and I don't have a fursona, this is just what I'd choose if I did."
wolf,The complete wildness and ability to synchronize as a pack is absolutely beautiful. They are wild and independent and yet they still rely on eachother as a whole to survive which is kind of how I view the human race as needing to be. They are elegant and graceful and strong; all qualities I wish to possess. Wolves are simply amazing. 
rat,"People often call me a rat, referring to my pranks, sharp tongue and agility."
dragon,"It fit my personality traits, along with a fascination with the creatures since childhood"
lizard,I love reptiles. Plain and simple. 
redfox,Foxes are my favourite animals. They are pretty and smart and very misunderstood in my country. Pretty much always loved foxes :)
domesticcat,I just feel like a cat most closely identifies with my personality :3
arcticfox,"I have always had an affinity for foxes. I hate that they are often portrayed as sluts, though."
wolf,wolsky fits my personality ^.^
collie,"I'm not sure exactly, because I could consider more inclined to that as a kind of animal that I like. To be honest, I am in search of my true identity as a furry, so that the animal character that I choose must have a more intimate connection with my personality, strengths and weaknesses. And another reason is because as a child I always had an attraction to reptiles, then I am strongly committed to the idea that I am a dragon after learning about the furry fandom, and why a dragon? Well because I think they are some magnificent creatures and I love them."
redfox,Foxes are jerks and so am I. 
dragon,"Yes, Scales"
wolf,"One of the reasons I identify with wolves is because they remind me of freedom in a way. They are powerful and difficult to control. They also always question the authority in their packs and fight for dominance. Plus, they're extremely smart for being animals."
snowleopard,I like Snow Leopards
wolf,Both wolf and bear just seem to match up with personality traits.
dragon,"I have always liked fantasy. I have a vivid imagination and think Dragons are a nice mix of a lot of other species.

I have been into fantasy role playing games, litterature and art since before I was a furry or knew about the furry fandom."
wolf,"Is hard to explain, is more of a non sentimental attraction to the animal, as well as the idea that from early age i behave in ways that people told me closely resemble a canine, and with time i don't know how but i feel like i lost my ""humanity"" and i only see my self as a wolf. "
redfox,I like foxes. 
othercanine,"My current fursona is a canine like hybrid which probably has to do with various things I've experienced and seen but also because I admire the shape and artistic aspects of canines such as fur, tail, ears, digiti grade feet also curiosity has a lot to do with it since I always wanted to know what being or feeling a sentient anthromorphic being would be like. Perhaps this also ties into my interest in the concept of shape shifting. "
rat,"I connect withs cats and rats. Ive always loved cats and felt like one. The rat is my chinese zodiac, I've had pet rats for the almost 8 years, and I just love rats so it felt right to add into my species."
raptor,Birds of prey are also known as raptors (wikipedia) and are bad ass
jackal,No real reason other than I like jackals. 
jackal,"Love canids, and it's the smallest one. Mirrors me physically. "
wolf,"They are very, very beautiful creatures. Their appearance is just so cool."
otherfeline,Because cheetahs are the best thing ever.
snowleopard,"I just find snow leopards sexy and beautiful, I appreciate their gracefulness in form and action. 

I find the crow/raven and the skunk to be personal animal totems of mine. Skunk is likely to become my first fursona, which is a large step for me. Skunk symbolizes self-respect, pacifism, and self-confidence, which I find I am growing in as I grow older and wiser. Crow has become less powerful in my life as I sweep away that which is old to make for the new, but Crow and Raven are wisdom to me, as well as flexibility and adaptation, which had been hallmarks of my life for years prior to me finding skunk becoming powerful in my life.

Plus, skunks are seen as sexual symbols and moderately rarer than most common fur types like canines and felines, and I've always liked being a little different than most."
domesticcat,"Grew up with cats. Always had a certain level of curiosity that brought about the old adage about cats, curiosity and death."
lizard,"A mix of traits that I thought were underrepresented in the fandom. The resulting character also has traits I desire, such as being agile and of appropriate weight."
snowleopard,A handful of the characteristics with in the snow leopard i found a connection with in of myself and my behaviors/traits.
rat,Yes
husky,"Huskies have always been one of my favorite breed of dog, but I also have another fursona. "
hyaena,I would choose dragon. See since I'm a wolf furry. I think I would look good with a dragon furry. 
tiger,"Not really, tigers are my favorite animals and I based the personality of my 'sona off of myself rather than an actual tiger"
otherdog,"I've always loved dogs both aesthetically and for their personalities. This seemed like the only appropriate ""fursona"" for me."
wolf,"I have always felt like wolves are confident and strong yet can be very caring towards close others, and it reminds me of myself."
otherfox,They're my favorite animals.
wolf,I like canines and I like how wolves act.
rat,"Cosmopolitan Distribution, Natural Behaviours, Social Behaviours, Intelligence, Social Pariah among Humans, Balanced Mix of Psychological Attributes"
