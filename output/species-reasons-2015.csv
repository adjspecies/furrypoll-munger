Tigers are representative of beauty, grace, independence, sensuality, and strong willpower, but also defined by anger and ferocity. All traits that embody myself. I also note that I chose a White Royal Bengal is because ideas related to Yin and Yang, But more for duality. the contrast between pure white and jet black (Royal Bengals have darker stripes) was something I loved as well. It took me years to settle because I believe you character should represent you and/or what you want to be. I'm honestly lacking on personal willpower, hence I like to draw from that.
Felines are also of note because I've always loved cats, and the said beauty and grace that embody has always been fascinating. As for the the quirks, I find myself to follow suit with them as well. I tend to have a crazy cat side and that 'sadistic' cat streak of torturing canine (not literally, but playing fetch and never throwing it while making it look like you did is satisfying or whatever thing you'd do with furry canines, my husband and I tickle our mate cause he is a dog and were both cats)",Primary character

other,"Came up with it late at night with my friends. I hadn't ever had a fursona before and I wanted it to be something personal, something that I could identify with but something that wouldn't just be like pouring my personality into an animal. We sat down and Googled species for what seemed like... a very long time until we stumbled across the white bison. This animal struck me as something rather interesting. They were unique, something people don't bastardize in the fandom, so I could avoid the common stigmas that plague species like horses, foxes, wolves, ect. I felt safe in picking a white bison because the species was something strong. They're hearty creatures that can endure a lot of harsh conditions. This was similar to my experiences in life thus far and I really liked that it subtly expressed my resilience without the use of flashy colours or exuberant special powers that some other furries tack onto their fursonas for added flair.
I wanted to be unique, in the same way everyone else in the fandom wants to be unique. I wanted to stand out, but my version of standing out didn't really fit the mold. The usual ""stand out"" fursonas are the ones that are either a combination of everything under the sun or the ones that are coloured brighter than the sun. For me, I wasn't really into that idea. I picked the white bison because it wasn't something I'd ever seen before in the fandom and it fit my personality parameters that I wanted to design in a character. My white bison isn't me by any means, but he'd probably be a good friend of mine.
I'm probably rambling here and I don't mean to. I'm writing this on my college campus after having gotten a few hours of sleep prior to a very early morning developmental psychology course. I guess I'll give you a too long didn't read here, but if you read all this, good on ya mate.

       This character's appearance is more of a writing tactic then it is for aesthetic purposes. So far, he has been an owl, hawk and a human, depending on his role in the story and where the story takes place (e.g. a desert). He will always be a writer of some kind, and he finds the prices of writing utensils cumbersome, thus he plucks mature feathers from his body and uses them as quills (when he is human, he uses the feathers of the birds he hunts for food (the irony...)). No, his blood isn't made of ink, but he does carry at least two ink wells with him.

"wolf, other","This is actually a long story, but I'll try to make it short here. Few years ago, in august 2010, I met this girl on skype. She was a fan of vampires, and I was fan of werewolves. We played the game ""Les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux"", which is quite the equivalent of ""Ultimate Werewolf"" in america. Since I know this game, I am a fan of the werewolves, the lycanthropes, and the wolves in general. I made a lot of roleplay with that girl, she became my girlfriend (it was a long-distance relationship as she was in Quebec, Canada, and I am in France), and I even came to her house for 3 months. After that, we broke up, but we are still friends. We made a forum called ""Lycampire"". It a RPG forum where there are, you got that, lycanthropes and vampires There are also humans and ""Lycampires"" (mix between the two species, there is just one as it is too powerful). Anyway. This forum was created because we made a lot of roleplay in Windows Live Messenger, or Skype. In one of these RP, there was this character, Elian. He was the bad guy. Once the story of this RP has been finished, I took this name for my new character. Elian Wonhalf was born. The first Werewolf, and so the first Lycanthrope. His name, Wonhalf comes from three words. Won, because the reason of the war in his story is because he won a battle against his brother. Half, because he is half human, half wolf. Also, if you remove the letter ""n"", ""h"", and ""a"", you got wolf. Where I live, if you compare a human with a wolf, it kinda means he is alone, and he is made to live alone. I am not saying that I would love to live my entire life alone, but I kinda like being alone. Also, wolves are seen as silent, wise, and old creatures. This is my model. I love silence, and I really want to be ""wise"" (even if it's weird to write). But I couldn't say I am not human at all. So I decided to keep a half of humanity in this character. I really loved Elian. As soon as I found about the furry community, I chose Elian as my main charac",Primary character

wolf,"Typically, I first began to identify myself as a fox, but to me it was just too cute and cuddly for how I actually am. And I'm not really sly, sleek, or petite. This was all before I made the full commitment to live as a furry : The day that I first envisioned and sketched my own thought up character, which is a wolf. I am a wolf. His personality is hugely influenced by his creator, and will never be abandoned for as long as he breathes. And either by coincidence or fate, I have gone through my military training under canine names for the platoons that I was assigned under : Wolfpack, and then Bulldogs. And with the same color that accents my character's eyes, and that isn't something faded or without such as grey, black, or white. That color is red, and like with my platoon name, it was a color that I saw every day and was always issued to me anytime that I bought or received any item that could have been literally anything else. And strangely enough, it continues to be that way. All of that set aside, I greatly admire the ways of real wolfpacks and at this point in my life, I feel like a lone wolf.",Primary character
